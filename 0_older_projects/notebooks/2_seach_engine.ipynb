       "{'Juventus FC': 'Juventus Football Club (from Latin: iuventūs, \\'youth\\'; Italian pronunciation: [juˈvɛntus]), commonly known as Juventus or colloquially as Juve (pronounced [ˈjuːve]),[5] is an Italian professional football club based in Turin, Piedmont, who compete in Serie A, the top tier of the Italian football league system. Founded in 1897 by a group of Torinese students, the club played in different grounds around the city, and plays now in Juventus Stadium.\\n\\nNicknamed la Vecchia Signora (\"the Old Lady\"), it has won 36 official league titles, 15 Coppa Italia trophies and nine Italian Super Cups, being the record holder for all these competitions; they also hold two Intercontinental Cups, two European Cup / UEFA Champions Leagues, one European Cup Winners\\' Cup, three UEFA Cups (Italian record), two UEFA Super Cups and one UEFA Intertoto Cup (Italian record).[6][7] Consequently, the side leads the historical Federazione Italiana Giuoco Calcio (FIGC) classification,[c] whilst on the international stage the club occupies the sixth position in Europe and the twelfth in the world for most confederation titles won with eleven trophies,[9] as well as the fourth in the all-time Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) competitions ranking,[d] having obtained the highest coefficient score during seven seasons since its introduction in 1979, the most for an Italian team in both cases and joint second overall in the last cited.\\n\\nFounded with the name of Sport-Club Juventus, initially as an athletics club,[11] it is the second oldest of its kind still active in the country after Genoa\\'s football section (1893) and has competed every season of the premier club division (reformulated in different formats until the Serie A inception in 1929) since its debut in 1900 with the exception of the 2006–07 season, being managed by the industrial Agnelli family almost continuously since 1923.[e] The relationship between the club and that dynasty is the oldest and longest in national sports, making Juventus one of the first professional sporting clubs ante litteram in the country,[13] having established itself as a major force in the national stage since the 1930s and at confederation level since the mid-1970s,[14] and becoming, in a nearly stable basis, one of the top-ten wealthiest in world football in terms of value, revenue and profit since the mid-1990s,[15] being listed on the Borsa Italiana since 2001.[16]\\n\\nUnder the management of Giovanni Trapattoni, the club won 13 trophies in the ten years before 1986, including six league titles and five international tournaments, and became the first to win all three seasonal competitions organised by the Union of European Football Associations: the 1976–77 UEFA Cup (first Southern European side to do so), the 1983–84 Cup Winners\\' Cup and the 1984–85 European Champions\\' Cup.[17] With successive triumphs in the 1984 European Super Cup and 1985 Intercontinental Cup, it became the first and thus far only in the world to complete a clean sweep of all five historical confederation trophies;[18] an achievement that they revalidated with the title won in the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup after another successful era led by Marcello Lippi,[19] becoming in addition, until 2022, the only professional Italian club to have won every ongoing honour available to the first team and organised by a national or international football association.[f] In December 2000, Juventus was placed seventh in the FIFA\\'s historic ranking of the best clubs in the world,[20] and nine years later was ranked second best club in Europe during the 20th century based on a statistical study series by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS), the highest for an Italian club in both.[21]\\n\\nThe club\\'s fan base is the largest at the national level and one of the largest worldwide.[22][23] Unlike most European sporting supporters\\' groups, which are often concentrated around their own club\\'s city of origin,[24] it is widespread throughout the whole country and the Italian diaspora, making Juventus a symbol of anticampanilismo (\"anti-parochialism\") and italianità (\"Italianness\").[25][26] Juventus players have won eight Ballon d\\'Or awards, four of these in consecutive years (1982–1985, an overall joint record), among these Michel Platini as well as three of the five recipients with Italian nationality as the first player representing Serie A, Omar Sívori, and the former member of the youth sector Paolo Rossi; they have also won four FIFA World Player of the Year awards, with winners as Roberto Baggio and Zinedine Zidane, a national record and third and joint second highest overall, respectively, in the cited prizes. Finally, the club has also provided the most players to the Italy national team—mostly in official competitions in almost uninterrupted way since 1924—who often formed the group that led the Azzurri squad to international success, most importantly in the 1934, 1982 and 2006 FIFA World Cups.[27][28]\\n\\nHistory\\nMain article: History of Juventus F.C.\\nEarly years (1897–1918)\\n\\nOne of the first Juventus club shot, 1899\\nJuventus was founded as Sport-Club Juventus in late 1897 by pupils from the Massimo d\\'Azeglio Lyceum school in Turin, among them Eugenio Canfari and Enrico Canfari.[29] It was renamed as Foot-Ball Club Juventus two years later.[30] The club joined the 1900 Italian Football Championship. Juventus played their first Italian Football Championship match on 11 March 1900 in a 1–0 defeat against Torinese.[31]\\n\\n\\nThe Juventus team during the 1905 season in which they won their first league title\\nIn 1904, businessman Marco Ajmone-Marsan revived the finances of Juventus, making it possible to transfer the training field from piazza d\\'armi to the more appropriate Velodrome Umberto I. During this period, the team wore a pink and black kit. Juventus first won the 1905 Italian Football Championship while playing at their Velodrome Umberto I ground. By this time, the club colours had changed to black and white stripes, inspired by English side Notts County.[32]\\n\\nThere was a split at the club in 1906, after some of the staff considered moving Juve out of Turin.[30] Alfred Dick, the club\\'s president,[g] was unhappy with this, and left with some prominent players to found FBC Torino, which in turn spawned the Derby della Mole.[33] Juventus spent much of this period steadily rebuilding after the split, surviving the First World War.[32]\\n\\nIn 1913, Juventus was relegated to the second division after ended in last place, but after pressure made by their executives to the Italian Federation, it was decided to increase the number of teams in the following season, that permitted Juventus to remain in the top league.[34][35]\\n\\nLeague dominance (1923–1980)\\n\\nThe \"Magical Trio\" (Trio Magico) of Omar Sívori, John Charles, and Giampiero Boniperti in 1957\\nIn 1922, a new stadium was inaugurated and, a year later, FIAT vice president Edoardo Agnelli was elected club\\'s president.[30] These two events helped the club to its second league championship in the 1925–26 Prima Divisione, after beating Alba Roma in a two-legged final with an aggregate score of 12–1.[32] The club established itself as a major force in Italian football in the 1930s, becoming the country\\'s first professional club and the first with a decentralised fan base.[36] This led Juventus to win a record of five consecutive Italian football championships and form the core of the Italy national football team during the Vittorio Pozzo era, including the 1934 FIFA World Cup winning squad, with star players like Raimundo Orsi, Luigi Bertolini, Giovanni Ferrari, and Luis Monti, among others.[37][38]\\n\\nJuventus moved to the Stadio Comunale, but for the rest of the 1930s and the majority of the 1940s they were unable to recapture championship dominance. After the Second World War, Gianni Agnelli was appointed president.[30] In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the club added two more league championships to its name, winning the 1949–50 Serie A under the management of Englishman Jesse Carver, and then repeating in the 1951–52 Serie A. For the 1957–58 Serie A, two new strikers, Welshman John Charles and Italian Argentine Omar Sívori, were signed to play alongside longtime member Giampiero Boniperti. In the 1959–60 Juventus F.C. season, they beat Fiorentina to complete their first league and cup double, winning the 1959–60 Serie A and the 1960 Coppa Italia final. Boniperti retired in 1961 as the all-time top scorer at the club, with 182 goals in all competitions, a club record that stood for 45 years.[39]\\n\\n\\nThe Juventus team during the 1971-1972 Serie A season\\nDuring the rest of the decade, the club only won the 1966–67 Serie A.[32] The 1970s saw Juventus further solidify their strong position in Italian football, and under former player Čestmír Vycpálek they won the scudetto in the 1971–72 Serie A, and followed through in the 1972–73 Serie A,[32] with players like as Roberto Bettega, Franco Causio, and José Altafini breaking through. During the rest of the decade, they won the league thrice more, with defender Gaetano Scirea contributing significantly. The latter two success in Serie A was under Giovanni Trapattoni, who also led the club to their first ever major European title, the 1976–77 UEFA Cup, and helped the club\\'s domination continue on into the early part of the 1980s.[40]\\n\\nEuropean stage (1980–1993)\\n\\n\\nTacconi\\nScirea (c)\\nFavero\\nBrio\\nCabrini\\nBonini\\nTardelli\\nBriaschi\\nPlatini\\nRossi\\nBoniek\\n1985 European Cup final starting lineup\\nThe club led under Trapattoni in the 1980s brought them the league title three more times by 1984.[32] This meant Juventus had won 20 Italian league titles and were allowed to add a second golden star to their shirt, becoming the only Italian club to achieve this.[40] Around this time, the club\\'s players were attracting considerable attention, and Paolo Rossi was named European Footballer of the Year following his contribution to Italy\\'s victory in the 1982 FIFA World Cup, where he was named Player of the Tournament.[41]\\n\\nFrenchman Michel Platini was awarded the European Footballer of the Year title for three years in a row in 1983, 1984 and 1985, which is a record.[42] Juventus are the first and one of the only two clubs to have players from their club winning the award in four consecutive years.[43][h] It was Platini who scored the winning goal in the 1985 European Cup final against Liverpool; this was marred by the Heysel Stadium disaster, which changed European football.[45] That year, Juventus became the first club in the history of European football to have won all three major UEFA competitions;[46][47] after their triumph in the 1985 Intercontinental Cup, the club also became the first and thus far the only in association football history to have won all five possible confederation competitions,[48] an achievement that it revalidated with a sixth title won in the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup.[49][50]\\n\\nWith the exception of winning the closely contested 1985–86 Serie A, the rest of the 1980s were not very successful for the club. As well as having to contend with Diego Maradona\\'s Napoli, both of the Milanese clubs, A.C. Milan and Inter Milan, won Italian championships; Juventus achieved a double by winning the 1989–90 Coppa Italia and the 1990 UEFA Cup final under the guidance of former club legend Dino Zoff.[32] In 1990, Juventus also moved into their new home, the Stadio delle Alpi, which was built for the 1990 FIFA World Cup.[51] Despite the arrival of Italian star Roberto Baggio later that year for a world football transfer record fee, the early 1990s under Luigi Maifredi and subsequently Trapattoni once again also saw little success for Juventus, as they only managed to win the 1993 UEFA Cup final.[52]\\n\\nRenewed international success (1994–2004)\\n\\n\\nPeruzzi\\nFerrara\\nVierchowod\\nTorricelli\\nPessotto\\nSousa\\nConte\\nDeschamps\\nRavanelli\\nDel Piero\\nVialli (c)\\n1996 Champions League final starting lineup\\nMarcello Lippi took over as Juventus manager at the start of the 1994–95 Serie A.[30] His first season at the helm of the club was a successful one, as Juventus recorded their first Serie A championship title since the mid-1980s, as well as the 1995 Coppa Italia final.[32] The crop of players during this period featured Ciro Ferrara, Roberto Baggio, Gianluca Vialli, and a young Alessandro Del Piero. Lippi led Juventus to the 1995 Supercoppa Italiana and the 1995–96 UEFA Champions League, beating Ajax on penalties after a 1–1 draw in which Fabrizio Ravanelli scored for Juventus.[53]\\n\\nThe club did not rest long after winning the European Cup, as more highly regarded players were brought into the fold in the form of Zinedine Zidane, Filippo Inzaghi, and Edgar Davids. At home, Juventus won the 1996–97 Serie A, successfully defended their title in the 1997–98 Serie A, won the 1996 UEFA Super Cup,[54] and followed through with the 1996 Intercontinental Cup.[55] Juventus reached two consecutive Champions League finals during this period but lost out to Borussia Dortmund and Real Madrid,[56][57] respectively in 1997 and 1998.[58][59]\\n\\nAfter a two-and-a-half-season absence, Lippi returned to the club in 2001, following his replacement Carlo Ancelotti\\'s dismissal, signing big name players like Gianluigi Buffon, David Trezeguet, Pavel Nedvěd, and Lilian Thuram, helping the team to win the 2001–02 Serie A, which was their first since 1998, and confirmed themselves in the 2002–03 Serie A.[32] Juventus were also part of the all Italian 2003 UEFA Champions League final but lost out to Milan on penalties after the game ended in a 0–0 draw. At the conclusion of the following season, Lippi was appointed as the Italy national team\\'s head coach, bringing an end to one of the most fruitful managerial spells in Juventus\\'s history.[40]\\n\\nCalciopoli scandal (2004–2007)\\nFabio Capello was appointed as Juventus\\'s coach in 2004 and led the club to two more consecutive Serie A first places. In May 2006, Juventus emerged as one of the five clubs linked to the Calciopoli scandal. In July, Juventus was placed at the bottom of the league table and relegated to Serie B for the first time in its history. The club was also stripped of the 2004–05 Serie A title, while the 2005–06 Serie A winner, after a period sub judice, was declared to be third-placed Inter Milan.[60] This remains a much debated and controversial issue,[61][62][63] particularly due to Inter Milan\\'s later revealed involvement, the 2004 championship (the sole being investigated) deemed regular and not fixed,[64][65][66] Juventus being absolved as club in the ordinary justice proceedings,[67][68] their renounce to the Italian civil courts appeal, which could have cleared the club\\'s name and avoid relegation, after FIFA threatened to suspend the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) and barring all Italian clubs from international play,[69][70][71] and the motivations,[72] such as sentimento popolare (people\\'s feelings),[73] and the newly created ad-hoc rule used to relegate the club.[74][75][76]\\n\\n\\nStar goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon was among a group of players who remained with the club following their demotion to Serie B in 2006.\\nMany key players left following their relegation to Serie B, including Thuram, star striker Zlatan Ibrahimović, midfielders Emerson and Patrick Vieira, and defensive stalwarts Fabio Cannavaro and Gianluca Zambrotta;[77] other big name players, such as Del Piero, Buffon, Trezeguet, and Nedvěd, as well as the club\\'s future defense core Giorgio Chiellini, remained to help the club return to Serie A,[78] while youngsters from the Campionato Nazionale Primavera (youth team), such as Sebastian Giovinco and Claudio Marchisio, were integrated into the first team.[79][80] Juventus won the Cadetti title (Serie B championship) despite starting with a points deduction and gained promotion straight back up to the top division, with Del Piero claiming the top scorer award with 21 goals, as league winners after the 2006–07 Serie B season.[81]\\n\\nAs early as 2010, when many other clubs were implicated and Inter Milan, Livorno, and Milan liable of direct Article 6 violations in the 2011 Palazzi Report, Juventus considered challenging the stripping of their scudetto from 2005 and the non-assignment of the 2006 title, dependent on the results of Calciopoli trials connected to the 2006 scandal.[82] When former general manager Luciano Moggi\\'s conviction in criminal court in connection with the scandal was partially written off by the Supreme Court in March 2015,[83][84] the club sued the FIGC for €443 million for damages caused by their 2006 relegation. Then-FIGC president Carlo Tavecchio offered to discuss reinstatement of the lost scudetti in exchange for Juventus dropping the lawsuit.[85]\\n\\nIn September 2015, the Supreme Court released a 150-page document that explained its final ruling of the case, based on the controversial 2006 sports ruling, which did not take in consideration the other clubs involved because they could not be put on trial due to the statute of limitations, and it would be necessary to request and open a revocation of judgment pursuant to Article 39 of the Code of Sports Justice. Despite his remaining charges being cancelled without a new trial due to statute of limitations, the court confirmed that Moggi was actively involved in the sporting fraud, which was intended to favour Juventus and increase his own personal benefits according to La Gazzetta dello Sport.[86] As did the Naples court in 2012,[87][88] the court commented that the developments and behavior of other clubs and executives were not investigated in depth.[89] Once they exhausted their appeals in Italy\\'s courts,[90] both Moggi and Giraudo appealed to the European Court of Human Rights in March 2020; Giraudo\\'s was accepted in September 2021.[91][92] Juventus continued to present new appeals,[93] which were declared inadmissible.[94]\\n\\nReturn to Serie A (2007–2011)\\nAfter making their comeback for the 2007–08 Serie A, Juventus appointed Claudio Ranieri as manager.[95] They finished in third place in their first season back in the top flight and qualified for the 2008–09 UEFA Champions League\\'s third qualifying round in the preliminary stages. Juventus reached the group stages, where they beat Real Madrid in both home and away legs, before losing in the knockout round to Chelsea. Ranieri was sacked following a string of unsuccessful results and Ciro Ferrara was appointed as manager on a temporary basis for the last two games of the 2008–09 Serie A,[96] before being subsequently appointed as the manager for the 2009–10 Serie A.[97]\\n\\nFerrara\\'s stint as Juventus manager proved to be unsuccessful, with Juventus knocked out of 2009–10 UEFA Champions League, and also of the 2009–10 Coppa Italia, as well as just lying on the sixth place in the league table at the end of January 2010, leading to the dismissal of Ferrara and the naming of Alberto Zaccheroni as caretaker manager. Zaccheroni could not help the side improve, as Juventus finished the season in seventh place in Serie A. For the 2010–11 Serie A, Jean-Claude Blanc was replaced by Andrea Agnelli as the club\\'s president. Agnelli\\'s first action was to replace Zaccheroni and director of sport Alessio Secco with Sampdoria manager Luigi Delneri and director of sport Giuseppe Marotta.[98] Delneri failed to improve their fortunes and was dismissed, and former player and fan favourite Antonio Conte, fresh after winning promotion with Siena, was named as Delneri\\'s replacement.[99] In September 2011, Juventus relocated to the new Juventus Stadium, known as the Allianz Stadium since 2017.[100]\\n\\nNine consecutive scudetti (2011–2020)\\n\\nPlaymaker Andrea Pirlo playing for Juventus in 2012\\nWith Conte as manager, Juventus were unbeaten for the entire 2011–12 Serie A season. Towards the second half of the season, the team was mostly competing with northern rivals Milan for first place in a tight contest. Juventus won the title on the 37th matchday after beating Cagliari 2–0 and Milan losing to Inter 4–2. After a 3–1 win in the final matchday against Atalanta, Juventus became the first team to go the season unbeaten in the current 38-game format.[101] In 2013–14 Serie A, Juventus won a third consecutive scudetto with a record 102 points and 33 wins.[102][103] The title was the 30th official league championship in the club\\'s history.[104] They also achieved the semi-finals of 2013–14 UEFA Europa League, where they were eliminated at home against ten-man Benfica\\'s catenaccio, missing the 2014 UEFA Europa League final at the Juventus Stadium.[105][106]\\n\\n\\nJuventus captain Giorgio Chiellini receiving the 2016–17 Coppa Italia from Sergio Mattarella, the president of Italy\\nIn the 2014–15 Serie A, Massimiliano Allegri was appointed as manager, with whom Juventus won their 31st official title, making it a fourth-straight, as well as achieving a record tenth Coppa Italia, after beating Lazio 2–2 in the 2015 Coppa Italia final, for the domestic double.[107] The club also beat Real Madrid 3–2 on aggregate in the semi-finals of the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League to face Barcelona in the 2015 UEFA Champions League final in Berlin for the first time since the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League.[108] Juventus lost the final against Barcelona 3–1.[109] In the 2016 Coppa Italia final, the club won the title for the 11th time and second straight win, becoming the first team in Italy\\'s history to win Serie A and Coppa Italia doubles in back-to-back seasons.[110][111][112] In the 2017 Coppa Italia final, Juventus won their 12th Coppa Italia title in a 2–0 win over Lazio, becoming the first team to win three consecutive titles.[113] Four days later on 21 May, Juventus became the first team to win six consecutive Serie A titles.[114] In the 2017 UEFA Champions League final, their second Champions League final in three years, Juventus were defeated 1–4 by defending champions Real Madrid; the 2017 Turin stampede happened ten minutes before the end of the match.[115][116] In the 2018 Coppa Italia final, Juventus won their 13th title and fourth in a row in a 4–0 win over Milan, extending the all-time record of successive Coppa Italia titles.[117] Juventus then secured their seventh consecutive Serie A title, extending the all-time record of successive triumphs in the competition.[118]\\n\\n\\nJuventus\\'s signing of Cristiano Ronaldo in 2018 elevated the club\\'s popularity\\nJuventus, eager to secure the Champions League title, signed Cristiano Ronaldo for £99.2 million from Real Madrid on 10 July 2018.[119] In Italy, the signing was dubbed the \"deal of the century.\"[119] For Juventus, the signing of Ronaldo went beyond football—it represented a step toward elevating the club\\'s status as a global business. Deloitte ranked the world\\'s richest clubs earlier in the year and Juventus ranked 10th; by leveraging Ronaldo\\'s massive social media following and commercial appeal, the club expected to close the financial gap with the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona, and Manchester United.[119] In the 2018 Supercoppa Italiana, which was held in January 2019, Juventus and Milan, who were tied for Supercoppa Italiana wins with seven each, played against each other; Juventus won their eight title after beating Milan 1–0.[120] In April 2019, Juventus secured their eighth consecutive Serie A title, further extending the all-time record of successive triumphs in the competition.[121] Following Allegri\\'s departure,[122] Maurizio Sarri was appointed manager of the club ahead of the 2019–20 Juventus F.C. season.[123] Juventus were confirmed 2019–20 Serie A champions, reaching an unprecedented milestone of nine consecutive league titles.[124] Ronaldo was key to Juventus\\'s continuation of domestic success; notable achievements include his reaching 100 goals in Serie A quicker than anyone in the league\\'s history.[125] He also equalled the record of scoring in the most consecutive Serie A matches (11).[125]\\n\\nRecent history (2020–present)\\nOn 8 August 2020, Sarri was sacked from his managerial position, one day after Juventus were eliminated from the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League by Lyon.[126] On the same day, former player Andrea Pirlo was announced as the new coach, signing a two-year contract.[127] In the 2020 Supercoppa Italiana, which was held in January 2021, Juventus won their ninth title after a 2–0 victory against Napoli.[128] With Inter Milan\\'s win of the 2020–21 Serie A, Juventus\\'s run of nine consecutive titles came to an end;[129] the club managed to secure a fourth-place finish on the final day of the league, granting Juventus qualification to the following season\\'s Champions League.[130] In the 2021 Coppa Italia final, Juventus won their 14th title.[131] On 28 May, Juventus sacked Pirlo from his managerial position,[132][133] and announced Allegri\\'s return to the club as manager after two years away from management on a four-year contract.[134] During the three seasons that featured Ronaldo, the Champions League all-time top scorer, Juventus disappointingly failed to win the Champions League.[125] Ronaldo left the club for Manchester United in late 2021.[125]\\n\\nAlthough Allegri had considered the victory of the scudetto as a seasonal goal,[135] Juventus reached another fourth place in the league.[136] After losing 4–2 after extra time to Inter Milan in the 2022 Coppa Italia final, the 2021–22 Juventus F.C. season marked the first season since 2010–11 in which the club had not won a trophy.[136] In the 2022–23 season, Juventus had one victory and five defeats in their Champions League group, achieving their worst-ever score (3 points) and their greatest-ever number of losses in the competition\\'s group stage.[137] Through their better goal difference over fourth-placed Maccabi Haifa, the team finished third and dropped down into the Europa League,[137] in which they were defeated 2–1 by Sevilla after extra time at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium in the semi-final.[138] On 28 November 2022, the entire board of directors resigned from their respective positions, Andrea Agnelli as president, Pavel Nedvěd as vice president, and Maurizio Arrivabene as CEO.[139][140][141] Agnelli\\'s presidency was the most victorious of the club\\'s history, with 19 titles won.[142] Exor, the club\\'s controlling shareholder, appointed Gianluca Ferrero as its new chairman ahead of the shareholders\\' meeting on 18 January 2023.[143]\\n\\nTwo days later, after being acquitted by the FIGC\\'s Court of Appeal in April–May 2022,[144][145][146] Juventus were deducted 15 points as punishment for capital gain violations,[147] as part of an investigation related to the 2019–2021 budgets during the COVID-19 pandemic starting in November 2021.[148] This was harsher than the point deduction recommended by the FIGC prosecutor, who said that in the standings Juventus \"must now finish behind Roma, outside the European Cup area\".[149][150] The penalty caused an uproar and protests among Juventus supporters,[151] who cancelled, or threatened to do so, their Sky Sport and DAZN subscriptions.[152][153][154] Following Juventus\\'s appeal, the decision had initially been reversed on 20 April 2023,[155] but the club were given a new penalty, this time of ten points, on 22 May.[156] Within the aforementioned FIGC\\'s inquiry, on 29 May, Juventus proposed a plea bargain for their false accounting on staff salaries;[157][158] the request was accepted one day later and Juventus only received a fine of €718,240 without any further penalty.[159] Juventus finished the 2022–23 Serie A in seventh place and qualified to the UEFA Europa Conference League with 62 points.[i][160] However, on 28 July, UEFA ejected Juventus from its competitions for one year as the club violated a settlement agreement with UEFA signed in August 2022.[161] The 2023–24 season was the first in which Juventus did not participate in UEFA competitions since 2011–12.[161]\\n\\nDue to their UEFA competition ban, Juventus only had the Serie A title and Coppa Italia to play for during the 2023–24 season. In Serie A Juventus finished the season in third place with 71 points, qualifying for the champions league but they finished the season 23 points behind a dominant Inter Milan side. In the Coppa Italia, Juventus made the final where they would face Atalanta. Juventus would win the final 1–0 after an early goal from Dušan Vlahović, earning the Turin club their 15th Coppa Italia title.[162] However the game was not without controversy, as manager Massimiliano Allegri was sent off in stoppage time after shouting at the 4th official. Allegri after leaving the pitch was reported to have attacked the referees, threatened a journalist and waved off sporting director Cristiano Giuntoli during the post match celebrations.[163]\\n\\nDespite winning the Coppa Italia, two days after the final Juventus announced they had sacked Allegri, mainly due to his behaviour during the game not being in line with the club\\'s values,[164] Juventus announced that former defender Paolo Montero would take charge for the final two league games of the season.\\n\\nOn 12 June 2024, Juventus announced that former Bologana coach and Inter Milan midfielder Thiago Motta would become their new head coach for the 2024–25 season, on a three-year contract.[165]\\n\\nCrest and colours\\n\\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Juventus F.C. kits.\\nJuventus have played in black and white striped shirts, with white shorts, sometimes black shorts since 1901–02 season.[166] Originally, they played in pink shirts with a black tie. The father of one of the players made the earliest shirts, but continual washing faded the colour so much that in December 1901 the club sought to replace them.[167] Juventus asked one of their team members, Englishman John Savage, if he had any contacts in England who could supply new shirts in a colour that would better withstand the elements. He had a friend who lived in Nottingham, who being a Notts County supporter, shipped out the black and white striped shirts to Turin.[167] Juventus have worn the shirts ever since, considering the colours to be aggressive and powerful.[167]\\n\\nJuventus\\'s official emblem has undergone different and small modifications since the 1920s. The previous modification of the Juventus badge took place in 2004, when the emblem of the team changed to a black-and-white oval shield of a type used by Italian ecclesiastics. It is divided in five vertical stripes: two white stripes and three black stripes, inside which are the following elements, while in its upper section the name of the society superimposed on a white convex section, over golden curvature (gold for honour). The white silhouette of a charging bull is in the lower section of the oval shield, superimposed on a black old French shield and the charging bull is a symbol of the comune of Turin. There is also a black silhouette of a mural crown above the black spherical triangle\\'s base. This is a reminiscence to Augusta Tourinorum, the old city of the Roman era which the present capital of Piedmont region is its cultural heiress. In January 2017, president Andrea Agnelli announced the change to the Juventus badge for a logotype. More specifically, it is a pictogram composed by a stylised Black and White \"J\" which Agnelli said reflects \"the Juventus way of living.\"[168] Juventus was the first team in sports history to adopt a star as a symbol associated with any competition\\'s triumph, who added one above their badge in 1958 to represent their tenth Italian Football Championship and Serie A title, and has since become popularized with other clubs as well.[169]\\n\\nIn the past, the convex section of the emblem had a blue colour (another symbol of Turin) and it was concave in shape. The old French shield and the mural crown, also in the lower section of the emblem, had a considerably greater size. The two \"Golden Stars for Sport Excellence\" were located above the convex and concave section of Juventus\\'s emblem. During the 1980s, the club emblem was the blurred silhouette of a zebra, alongside the two golden stars with the club\\'s name forming an arc above.\\n\\nJuventus unofficially won their 30th league title in 2011–12, but a dispute with the FIGC, which stripped Juventus of their 2004–05 title and did not assign them the 2005–06 title due to their involvement in the Calciopoli scandal, left their official total at 28; the club elected to wear no stars at all the following season, but added the message \"30 sul campo\" (\"30 on the pitch\", referring to the two titles that were won but vacated) underneath the badge.[170] Juventus won their 30th title in 2013–14 and thus earned the right to wear their third star, but Agnelli stated that the club suspended the use of the stars until another team wins their 20th championship, having the right to wear two stars \"to emphasise the difference\".[171] For the 2015–16 season, Juventus reintroduced the stars and added the third star to their jersey as well with new kit manufacturers Adidas, in addition to the Coppa Italia badge for winning their tenth Coppa Italia the previous season.[172] For the 2016–17 season, Juventus re-designed their kit with a different take on the trademark black and white stripes.[173] For the 2017–18 season, Juventus introduced the J shaped logo onto the kits.[174]\\n\\nIn September 2015, Juventus officially announced a new project called JKids for its junior supporters on its website. Along with this project, Juventus also introduced a new mascot to all its fans which is called J. J is a cartoon-designed zebra, black and white stripes with golden edge piping on its body, golden shining eyes, and three golden stars on the front of its neck.[175] J made its debut at Juventus Stadium on 12 September 2015.[176]\\n\\nDuring its history, the club has acquired a number of nicknames, la Vecchia Signora (the Old Lady) being the best example. The \"old\" part of the nickname is a pun on Juventus which means \"youth\" in Latin. It was derived from the age of the Juventus star players towards the middle of the 1930s. The \"lady\" part of the nickname is how fans of the club affectionately referred to it before the 1930s. The club is also nicknamed la Fidanzata d\\'Italia (lit.\\u2009\\'the Girlfriend of Italy\\'), because over the years it has received a high level of support from Southern Italian immigrant workers (particularly from Naples and Palermo), who arrived in Turin to work for FIAT since the 1930s. Other nicknames include [la] Madama (Piedmontese for Madam), i bianconeri (lit.\\u2009\\'the black-and-whites\\'), le zebre (lit.\\u2009\\'the zebras\\')[j] in reference to Juventus\\'s colours. I gobbi (lit.\\u2009\\'the hunchbacks\\') is the nickname that is used to define Juventus supporters, but is also used sometimes for team\\'s players. The most widely accepted origin of gobbi dates to the fifties, when the bianconeri wore a large jersey. When players ran on the field, the jersey, which had a laced opening at the chest, generated a bulge over the back (a sort of parachute effect), making the players look hunchbacked.[177]\\n\\nThe official anthem of Juventus is Juve (storia di un grande amore), or Juve (story of a great love) in English, written by Alessandra Torre and Claudio Guidetti, in the version of the singer and musician Paolo Belli composed in 2007.[178] In 2016, a documentary film called Black and White Stripes: The Juventus Story was produced by the La Villa brothers about Juventus.[179] On 16 February 2018, the first three episodes of a docu-series called First Team: Juventus, which followed the club throughout the season, by spending time with the players behind the scenes both on and off the field, was released on Netflix; the other three episodes were released on 6 July 2018.[180] On 25 November 2021, an eight-episode docu-series called All or Nothing: Juventus, which followed the club throughout the season, by spending time with the players behind the scenes both on and off the field, was released on Amazon Prime.[181]\\n\\nStadiums\\nJuventus Stadium\\nAllianz Stadium\\n\\nLocation\\tCorso Gaetano Scirea,\\n10151 Turin, Italy\\nOwner\\tJuventus F.C.\\nOperator\\tJuventus F.C.\\nCapacity\\t41,507 seated\\nConstruction\\nBroke ground\\t1 March 2009\\nOpened\\t8 September 2011\\nConstruction cost\\t€155,000,000[182]\\nArchitect\\tHernando Suarez,\\nGino Zavanella,\\nGiorgetto Giugiaro\\nMain articles: Juventus Stadium, Stadio Olimpico di Torino, Stadio delle Alpi, Stadio di Corso Marsiglia, and Stadio Motovelodromo Umberto I\\nAfter the first two years (1897 and 1898), during which Juventus played in the Parco del Valentino and Parco Cittadella, their matches were held in the Piazza d\\'Armi Stadium until 1908, except in 1905 (the first year of the scudetto) and in 1906, years in which they played at the Corso Re Umberto.\\n\\nFrom 1909 to 1922, Juventus played their internal competitions at Corso Sebastopoli Camp before moving the following year to Corso Marsiglia Camp, where they remained until 1933, winning four league titles. At the end of 1933, they began to play at the new Stadio Benito Mussolini inaugurated for the 1934 World Championships. After the Second World War, the stadium was renamed as Stadio Comunale Vittorio Pozzo. Juventus played home matches at the ground for 57 years, a total of 890 league matches.[183] The team continued to host training sessions at the stadium until July 2003.[184]\\n\\nFrom 1990 until the 2005–06 season, the Torinese side contested their home matches at Stadio delle Alpi, built for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, although in very rare circumstances the club played some home games in other stadia such as Renzo Barbera at Palermo, Dino Manuzzi in Cesena and the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza in Milan.[184]\\n\\nIn August 2006, Juventus returned to play in the Stadio Comunale, then known as Stadio Olimpico, after the restructuring of the stadium for the 2006 Winter Olympics onward. In November 2008, Juventus announced that they would invest around €120 million to build a new ground, the Juventus Stadium, on the site of delle Alpi.[185] Unlike the old ground, there is not a running track and instead the pitch is only 7.5 metres away from the stands.[4] The capacity is 41,507.[4] Work began during spring 2009 and the stadium was opened on 8 September 2011, ahead of the start of the 2011–12 season.[186] Since 1 July 2017, the Juventus Stadium is known commercially as the Allianz Stadium of Turin until 30 June 2030.[187][188]\\n\\nSupporters\\nSee also: Juventus F.C. ultras\\n\\nJuventus fans in 2006\\nJuventus is the most-supported football club in Italy, with over 12 million fans or tifosi, which represent approximately 34% of the total Italian football fans according to a research published in September 2016 by Italian research agency Demos & Pi,[22] as well as one of the most supported football clubs in the world, with over 300 million supporters (41 million in Europe alone),[23] particularly in the Mediterranean countries to which a large number of Italian diaspora have emigrated.[189] The Torinese side has fan clubs branches across the globe.[190]\\n\\nDemand for Juventus tickets in occasional home games held away from Turin is high, suggesting that Juventus have stronger support in other parts of the country. Juventus is widely and especially popular throughout mainland Southern Italy, Sicily and Malta, leading the team to have one of the largest followings in its away matches,[191] more than in Turin itself.\\n\\nClub rivalries\\nMain articles: Derby della Mole, Derby d\\'Italia, Juventus F.C.–A.C. Milan rivalry, ACF Fiorentina–Juventus F.C. rivalry, and Juventus F.C.–S.S.C. Napoli rivalry\\n\\nScene from the Derby d\\'Italia in 1930\\nJuventus have significant rivalries with two main clubs.\\n\\nTheir traditional rivals are fellow Turin club Torino; matches between the two sides are known as the Derby della Mole (Turin Derby). The rivalry dates back to 1906 as Torino was founded by break-away Juventus players and staff.\\n\\nTheir most high-profile rivalry is with Inter Milan, another big Serie A club located in Milan, the capital of the neighbouring region of Lombardy. Matches between these two clubs are referred to as the Derby d\\'Italia (Derby of Italy) and the two regularly challenge each other at the top of the league table, hence the intense rivalry.[192] Until the Calciopoli scandal which saw Juventus forcibly relegated, the two were the only Italian clubs to have never played below Serie A. Notably, the two sides are the first and the second most supported clubs in Italy and the rivalry has intensified since the later part of the 1990s; reaching its highest levels ever post-Calciopoli, with the return of Juventus to Serie A.[192][193]\\n\\nThe rivalry with AC Milan is a rivalry between the two most titled and two of the most supported teams in Italy.[194] The match-ups between Milan and Juventus, is regarded as the championship of Serie A, and both teams were often fighting for the top positions of the standings, sometimes even decisive for the award of the title.[195]\\n\\nThey also have rivalries with Roma,[196] Fiorentina[197] and Napoli.[198]\\n\\nYouth programme\\nMain article: Juventus F.C. Youth Sector\\nThe Juventus youth set-up has been recognised as one of the best in Italy for producing young talents.[199] While not all graduates made it to the first team, many have enjoyed successful careers in the Italian top flight. Under long-time coach Vincenzo Chiarenza, the Primavera (under-19) squad enjoyed one of its successful periods, winning all age-group competitions from 2004 to 2006. Like Dutch club Ajax and many Premier League clubs, Juventus operates several satellite clubs and football schools outside of the country (i.e. United States, Canada, Greece, Saudi Arabia, Australia and Switzerland) and numerous camps in the local region to expand talent scouting.[200] On 3 August 2018, Juventus founded their professional reserve team, called Juventus U23 (renamed to Juventus Next Gen in August 2022),[201] playing in Serie C,[202] who won the Coppa Italia Serie C in 2020.[203] In the 2021–22 UEFA Youth League, the U19 squad reached the semi-finals, equalling the best-ever placing in the competition for a Serie A team.[204]\\n\\nThe youth system is also notable for its contribution to the Italian national senior and youth teams. 1934 World Cup winner Gianpiero Combi, 1936 Gold Medal and 1938 World Cup winner Pietro Rava, Giampiero Boniperti, Roberto Bettega, 1982 World Cup hero Paolo Rossi and more recently Claudio Marchisio and Sebastian Giovinco are a number of former graduates who have gone on to make the first team and full Italy squad.[205]',\n",
       " 'Inter Milan': 'Football Club Internazionale Milano, commonly referred to as Internazionale (pronounced [ˌinternat:sjoˈnaːle]) or simply Inter, and colloquially known as Inter Milan in English-speaking countries,[5][6][7] is an Italian professional football club based in Milan, Lombardy. Inter is the only Italian side to have always competed in the top flight of Italian football since its debut in 1909.\\n\\nFounded in 1908 following a schism within the Milan Foot-Ball and Cricket Club (now AC Milan), Inter won its first championship in 1910. Since its formation, the club has won 37 domestic trophies, including 20 league titles, nine Coppa Italia, and eight Supercoppa Italiana. From 2006 to 2010, the club won five successive league titles, equalling the all-time record at that time.[8] They have won the European Cup/Champions League three times: two back-to-back in 1964 and 1965, and then another in 2010. Their latest win completed an unprecedented Italian seasonal treble, with Inter winning the Coppa Italia and the Scudetto the same year.[9] The club has also won three UEFA Cups, two Intercontinental Cups and one FIFA Club World Cup.\\n\\nInter\\'s home games are played at the San Siro stadium, which they share with city rivals AC Milan. The stadium is the largest in Italian football with a capacity of 75,817.[10] They have long-standing rivalries with Milan, with whom they contest the Derby della Madonnina, and Juventus, with whom they contest the Derby d\\'Italia; their rivalry with the former is one of the most followed derbies in football.[11] As of 2024, Inter has the highest home game attendance in Italy and the fourth-highest attendance in Europe.[12] Since May 2024, the club has been owned by American asset management company Oaktree Capital Management.[13] Inter is one of the most valuable clubs in Italian and world football.[14]\\n\\nHistory\\nMain article: History of Inter Milan\\nFoundation and early years (1908–1960)\\n\\nInter squad in 1910\\n\"Questa notte splendida darà i colori al nostro stemma: il nero e l\\'azzurro sullo sfondo d\\'oro delle stelle.

It shall be called International, because we are brothers of the world.\"\\n\\n—\\u200a9 March 1908, Milan[16]\\nThe club was founded on 9 March 1908 as Football Club Internazionale, when a group of players left the Milan Cricket and Football Club (now AC Milan) to form a new club because they wanted to accept more foreign players.[17] The name of the club derives from the wish of its founding members to accept foreign players as well as Italians.[18] The club won its first championship in 1910 and its second in 1920.[19] The captain and coach of the first championship winning team was Virgilio Fossati,[20] who was later killed in battle while serving in the Italian army during World War I.[21]\\n\\nIn 1922, Inter was at risk of relegation to the second division, but they remained in the top league after winning two play-offs.\\n\\nSix years later, during the Fascist era, the club merged with the Unione Sportiva Milanese and, for political reasons, was renamed Società Sportiva Ambrosiana.[22] During the 1928–29 season, the team wore white jerseys with a red cross emblazoned on it; the jersey\\'s design was inspired by the flag and coat of arms of the city of Milan.[23] In 1929, the new club chairman Oreste Simonotti changed the club\\'s name to Associazione Sportiva Ambrosiana and restored the previous black-and-blue jerseys; however, supporters continued to call the team Inter, and in 1931 new chairman Pozzani succumbed to shareholder pressure and changed the name to Associazione Sportiva Ambrosiana-Inter.\\n\\n\\nGiuseppe Meazza still holds the record for the most goals scored in a debut season in Serie A, with 31 goals in his first season (1929–30).\\nInter won its third and fourth Serie A title in 1930 and 1938, and also their first Coppa Italia (Italian Cup) was won in 1939, led by Giuseppe Meazza one of the greatest Italian player of all time and the greatest scorer in Inter history with 284 goals, and after whom the San Siro stadium is officially named. A fifth championship followed in 1940, that ended a decade dominated by three teams: Inter, Bologna and the historic rival Juventus.\\n\\nIn the 30\\'s Inter also played for seven times in one of the first major European football cups, the Central European Cup, with Meazza that was a record three times topscorer of the competition; coached by Hungarian Árpád Weisz Inter reached the final of the competition in 1933, when after had won the first leg in Milan 2–1, lost 3–1 in 9 men against Austria Vienna. 4 out of 11 players of that team: Meazza, Luigi Allemandi, Attilio Demaría and Armando Castellazzi would go on to win the 1934 World Cup with Italian national team, while other four Inter players will contribute to the win of 1938 World Cup with Italy: Meazza, Ugo Locatelli, Giovanni Ferrari and Pietro Ferraris.\\n\\nAfter the end of World War II, the club\\'s name changed back to its original one, Internazionale,[2] and it come close to win Serie A title in two occasions, one in the last season of Grande Torino in 1949 and in 1951 with the contribution of great players acquired by president Carlo Masseroni in these years, like the first Dutch player in club history Faas Wilkes; Inter will win its sixth championship in 1953 and its seventh in 1954, for the first time in two consecutive years, coached by Alfredo Foni and led by two of the most prolific strikers in club history: István Nyers and Benito Lorenzi with Lennart Skoglund that completed the offensive trio.\\n\\nIn May 1955 Angelo Moratti became the new owner of Inter, and in the first years of his presidency got disappointing results despite strong players like Angelillo that scored an all-time record in a season in Serie A with 18 teams: 33 goals in 33 match in 1958-1959 season.\\n\\nMoratti in the following years put foundations to one of the greatest team in football history starting from the debut of a 16 years old Mario Corso and the acquisition of Aristide Guarneri in 1958, and under Argentinian coach Helenio Herrera starting in 1960 with the signing of Giacinto Facchetti and Armando Picchi.\\n\\nGrande Inter (1960–1967)\\n\\nLuis Suárez, Giacinto Facchetti, Joaquín Peiró and Gianfranco Bedin with 1965 European Cup trophy\\nIn 1960, manager Helenio Herrera joined Inter from Barcelona and in his first season as a coach in Milan, after have lead for most of the tournament lost the title in the last games of the season, with the infamous episode during Juventus-Inter held in Turin in April 1961 when the match was stopped for an invasion by Juventus supporters and the victory was assigned to Inter for 2-0 and then, after two months, in June before the last decisive match of Serie A with the two team tied in the first place the Italian Football Federation presieded by Juventus president Umberto Agnelli decided that the match between the two teams had to be replayed after the last game scheduled for the season; with Inter loss and a draw for Juventus, the following match became useless and in open contestation Angelo Moratti ordered Herrera to put Inter youth team against the Turinese squad: the match ended 9-1 for Juventus with the only goal scored for Inter by an 18 years old Sandro Mazzola that later will become one of the greatest legend in the history of the club.\\n\\n\\nHelenio Herrera, the most successful coach in club\\'s history, guided Inter for a record 9 seasons\\nAfter his first season in Milan Herrera brought with him for a record fee of 25 million pesetas[24] Spanish midfielder Luis Suárez who won the European Footballer of the Year in 1960 for his role in Barcelona\\'s La Liga/Fairs Cup double.[25] Herrera would transform Inter into one of the leading teams in Europe that would win three Serie A titles in four years, two European Cup and two Intercontinental Cup in a row.[26] He modified a 5–3–2 tactic known as the \"Verrou\" (\"door bolt\"), which created greater flexibility for counterattacks.[27] The catenaccio system was invented by an Austrian coach, Karl Rappan.[28] Rappan\\'s original system was implemented with four fixed defenders, playing a strict man-to-man marking system, plus a playmaker in the middle of the field, who plays the ball together with two midfield wings. Herrera would modify it by adding a fifth defender, the sweeper or libero, behind the two centre backs. The sweeper or libero, who acted as the free man, would deal with any attackers who went through the two centre backs.[29] Inter finished third in the Serie A in his first season, second the next year and first in his third season. Then followed a back-to-back European Cup victory in 1964 and 1965, earning him the title \"il Mago\" (\"the Wizard\").[29] The core of Herrera\\'s team were the attacking full-backs Tarcisio Burgnich and Giacinto Facchetti, Armando Picchi the sweeper, Suárez the playmaker, Jair the winger, Mario Corso the left midfielder and Sandro Mazzola, who played on the inside-right.[30][31][32][33][34]\\n\\n\\nLa \"Grande Inter\" in 1964–1965 season standing from left to right: Sarti, Guarneri, Facchetti, Tagnin, Burgnich, Picchi (c).

The team also won the Intercontinental Cup after have lost the first match in Argentine against Independiente 1–0, Inter won second leg 2–0 in San Siro with goals from Mazzola and Corso, in the third decisive match played in Santiago Bernabeu Inter won in extra-time with a goal from Mario Corso, the first Italian club to win the trophy.\\n\\nIn 1964 Inter added other important players Angelo Domenghini, Gianfranco Bedin and another Spanish Joaquín Peiró that played with constance and was decisive in European Cup where three foreign players could play in the same time while in Serie A only two were allowed to play.\\n\\nA year later, after have defeated Liverpool F.C. in the semi-final second leg 3–0 recovering from a 3–1 defeat at Anfield with Facchetti scoring the decisive goal, Inter repeated the feat by beating two-time winner Benfica in the final held at home, from a Jair goal, and then again beat Independiente in the Intercontinental Cup with a 3–0 win in San Siro, with two goals from Mazzola and one from Peirò, and a draw in Argentine, becoming the first European team to win two times in a row the competition. Inter came close to winning the Treble for the first time in European football history that year, after having also won the Serie A title, but lost the Coppa Italia final against Juventus in a game played in the last days of August 1965.\\n\\n\\nSandro Mazzola played for the highly successful Inter team remembered by the name of \"La Grande Inter\", during the 1960s.\\nInter again reached semifinals of the European cup in 1966, but this time lost against a Real Madrid team that would go on to win the tournament, while in national championship Herrera\\'s squad won the tenth scudetto in club history, the first Star.\\n\\nAt the end of the season Moratti signed two of the greatest players of all time: Franz Beckenbauer[36] and Eusebio,[37] but after 1966 World Cup when Italian National Team was eliminated by North Korea, Italian Federation decided to block new signings of foreign players who will last until 1980, avoided the contract with the two players.\\n\\nIn 1967, after Inter eliminated Real Madrid in quarterfinals, with Suárez injured, Inter lost the European Cup Final in Lisbon 2–1 to Celtic; a week later, despite the first position, with a lost against Mantova in the last match of the championship Inter lost also the Serie A title and a week later the Coppa Italia semifinal against Padova, putting an end de facto to the Grande Inter cicle with the first season without trophy since 1961–1962.[38] During that year, the club changed its name to Football Club Internazionale Milano, and in 1968 after 13 years Angelo Moratti sold the team to Ivanoe Fraizzoli, and also Helenio Herrera left the team.\\n\\nSubsequent achievements (1967–1991)\\n\\nA line-up of F.C.

During the 1970s and the 1980s, Inter also added two to its Coppa Italia tally, in 1977–78 and 1981–82 under coach Eugenio Bersellini.\\n\\nItalian federation reopened the possibility to sign foreign players in 1980, Inter signed among others Hansi Müller (1975–1982 VfB Stuttgart, 1982–1984 Inter), Karl-Heinz Rummenigge (1974–1984 Bayern Munich, 1984–1987 Inter) and Argentinian Daniel Passarella (1986–1988 Inter); other important players in that time were Italians Graziano Bini, Walter Zenga, Giuseppe Bergomi, Alessandro Altobelli, Gabriele Oriali, Riccardo Ferri, Gianpiero Marini and Giuseppe Baresi: Bergomi, Oriali, Marini and Altobelli were part of Italy squad that won 1982 FIFA World Cup.\\n\\nIn 1981 Inter reached for the sixth time in six participations European Cup Semifinals this time against Real Madrid, a classic match that will repeat in 3 different European competitions in the 80\\'s: in UEFA Cup Winners\\' Cup quarter-finals in 1983 and in Uefa Cup semi-finals in 1985 and 1986.\\n\\nLed by the German duo of Andreas Brehme and Lothar Matthäus, with Aldo Serena top scorer in Serie A with 22 goals, Argentine Ramón Díaz and Nicola Berti, Inter coached by Giovanni Trapattoni captured the 1989 Serie A championship ended with an all-time record for most points in Serie A history with 18 teams, with 58 points out of 68. Inter were unable to defend their title in the following season in a very competitive Serie A, despite adding fellow German Jürgen Klinsmann to the squad and winning their first Supercoppa Italiana at the start of the season.\\n\\nMixed fortunes (1991–2004)\\nThe 1990s was a lackluster period. While their great rivals Milan and Juventus were achieving success both domestically and in Europe, Inter enjoyed little success in the domestic league standings, their worst coming in 1993–94 when they finished just one point out of the relegation zone. Nevertheless, they achieved some European success, with three UEFA Cup victories, in 1991, 1994 and 1998.\\n\\nAfter the win of the 1990 World Cup of West Germany led by three Inter players, Matthews was awarded of Ballon d\\'Or and ended 1990–1991, his most prolific season in career, with 23 goals including 6 in 1991 UEFA Cup won against Roma in May 1991, the first European trophy since the Grande Inter period.\\n\\n\\nDennis Bergkamp with 1994 Uefa Cup trophy in San Siro\\nIn 1992, after a disappointing season, in sostitution of the three German players that left in the summer and with the new coach Osvaldo Bagnoli, Inter signed important players like the future Ballon d\\'Or Matthias Sammer, Rubén Sosa, the first Russian player in club history Igor Shalimov and others that will delude like Darko Pancev and Salvatore Schillaci; Inter ended the season second behind AC Milan coached by Fabio Capello.\\n\\nIn the following season Inter acquired from Ajax Wim Jonk and Dennis Bergkamp that, with 8 goals in the competition, led Inter to their second victory in UEFA Cup despite the worst result in club history in Serie A.\\n\\nWith Massimo Moratti\\'s takeover from Ernesto Pellegrini in 1995, Inter twice broke the world record transfer fee in this period (£19.5 million for Ronaldo from Barcelona in 1997 and £31 million for Christian Vieri from Lazio two years later).[40] Among Moratti first acquisitions in 1995 there were Javier Zanetti from Banfield, that will stay at Inter until 2014 with a record of 858 game played and with a record 13 season as a captain, Paul Ince from Manchester United and Roberto Carlos from Palmeiras that will be sold the next season to Real Madrid with many regrets and recriminations from fans.\\n\\nHowever, the 1990s remained the only decade in Inter\\'s history, alongside the 1940s, in which they did not win a single Serie A championship. This persistent lack of success led to poor relations between the fanbase and the chairman, the managers, and even some individual players.\\n\\nMoratti later became a target of the fans, especially when he sacked the much-loved coach Luigi Simoni after a few games into the 1998–99 season, five days after Inter have defeated Real Madrid 3–1 at San Siro in Champions League group stage with two goals from Roberto Baggio, and having just received the Italian manager of the year award for 1998 the day before being dismissed. That season despite 4 coaches changes Inter reached Champions League quarter Finals when it will be eliminated from Manchester United that would go on to win the trophy that year; Inter failed to qualify for any European competition for the first time in seven years, finishing in eighth place.\\n\\n\\nJerseys of Ronaldo (number 10), Zamorano (one plus eight) and Figo (seven) in the San Siro museum\\nIn the previous seasons in 1996–1997 Inter reached for third time Uefa Cup final losing this time at penalty in Giuseppe Meazza against Schalke 04 with Roy Hodgson that resigned shortly afterwards, instead in 1997–1998 under Simoni Inter had won his third UEFA Cup defending in Paris final Lazio 3–0 with goals from Ivan Zamorano, Zanetti and Ronaldo, and nearly won Serie A title, with many controversial referee decisions culminated in the decisive match against Juventus in Turin with Inter behind only 1 point with 4 games left, when referee didn\\'t concede a penalty on Ronaldo and after few seconds conceded a penalty for Juventus, that generated a turmoil on the pitch and a big scandal, with president Moratti that left the building shortly afterwards.\\n\\n\\nRonaldo\\'s first season with Inter ended with 34 goals scored in 47 matches.\\nThe following season, 1999–2000, Moratti appointed former Juventus manager Marcello Lippi, and signed players such as Angelo Peruzzi, Laurent Blanc, Clarence Seedorf from Real Madrid and also Vieri and Jugović and sold other important players like Diego Simeone, Youri Djorkaeff and Gianluca Pagliuca. The team came close to their first domestic success since 1989 when they reached the Coppa Italia final, only to be defeated by Lazio, in a match remembered for the second severe injury to the right knee of Ronaldo, who was returning after five months of inactivity, and which would keep him out for more than a year and a half.\\n\\nInter\\'s misfortunes continued the following season, losing the 2000 Supercoppa Italiana match against Lazio 4–3, after initially taking the lead through new signing Robbie Keane. They were also eliminated in the preliminary round of the Champions League by Swedish club Helsingborg, with Álvaro Recoba missing a crucial late penalty. Lippi was sacked after only a single game of the new season following Inter\\'s first ever Serie A defeat to Reggina. Marco Tardelli, chosen to replace Lippi, failed to improve results, and is remembered by Inter fans as the manager who lost 6–0 in the city derby against Milan.\\n\\nIn 2002 with new coach Hector Cuper, the acquisition of the second most expensive goalkeeper in the world at that time Francesco Toldo and the return after injury of Ronaldo in pair with Vieri, not only did Inter manage to make it to the UEFA Cup semi-finals, but were also only 45 minutes away from capturing the Scudetto when they needed to maintain their one-goal advantage away to Lazio. Inter were 2–1 up after only 24 minutes. Lazio equalised during first half injury time, and then scored two more goals by Simeone and Simone Inzaghi in the second half to secure victory that saw Juventus win the championship, Roma ended second and Inter third. After brilliant performances and have won 2002 World Cup with Brazil, Ronaldo demanded and ottened to be sold to Real Madrid for €45 million, and was replaced by Hernan Crespo from Lazio for €40 million, Seedorf was sold to AC Milan and Fabio Cannavaro was acquired from Parma.\\n\\nThe next season Inter finished as league runners-up with Vieri that was top scorer of Serie A with 24 goals in 23 matches, while Crespo set a new record for UCL Group stage with 8 goals in 6 matches but missed almost the rest of the season for a severe injury in January. In October 2002 in a home game against Lyon Inter was defeated for the first time in its history at home in European Cup/UEFA Champions League after 33 matches in 39 years.[41] Inter reached 2002–03 Champions League semi-finals against AC Milan, that were played also without Vieri out for injury, losing on the away goals rule with two draw in the same stadium in San Siro.\\n\\n2003–2004 season started well with an historic win for Inter and for Italian football in Champions League in Highbury against Arsenal of Invincibles with a 3–0 and a win against Dinamo Kyiv, but after a draw against Brescia in Serie A in October coach Cuper was sacked and was replaced by Alberto Zaccheroni that will end up eliminated from Champions League in group stage, and despite acquisition in January of strong players like Dejan Stankovic and Adriano, Inter will finish only 4th. Other members of the Inter \"family\" during this period who suffered were the likes of Vieri and Cannavaro, both of whom had their restaurants in Milan vandalised after the second defeats of the season to the Rossoneri 3–2 in February 2004 in Serie A, but most important was the resignation from presidency by Massimo Moratti in favour of Giacinto Facchetti in January 2004, that lasted until the premature death of Inter legend in September 2006.\\n\\nComeback and unprecedented treble (2004–2011)\\n\\nInter won the 2004–05 Coppa Italia, beating Roma.\\nOn 8 July 2004, Inter appointed former Lazio manager Roberto Mancini as its new head coach, with players who will make the history of Inter like Esteban Cambiasso, Julio Cesar, and in 2005 Walter Samuel and Luis Figo.[42] In his first season, the team collected 72 points from 18 wins, 18 draws and only two losses, as well as winning the Coppa Italia against Roma with two goal from Adriano and later the Supercoppa Italiana in Turin against Juventus with a goal from Juan Sebastián Verón.[43][44] On 11 May 2006, Inter won the Coppa Italia title for the second season in a row after defeating Roma with a 4–1 aggregate victory (a 1–1 scoreline in Rome and a 3–1 win at the San Siro).[45]\\n\\nInter were awarded the 2005–06 Serie A championship retrospectively, after title-winning Juventus was relegated and points were stripped from Milan due to the Calciopoli scandal.[46] During the following season, Inter with new players like Maicon, Maxwell, Patrick Vieira, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and the return of Crespo from Chelsea, went on a record-breaking run of 17 consecutive victories in Serie A, starting on 25 September 2006, with a 4–1 home victory over Livorno, and ending on 28 February 2007, after a 1–1 draw at home to Udinese.[47] On 22 April 2007, Inter won their second consecutive Scudetto—and first on the field since 1989—when they defeated Siena 2–1 at Stadio Artemio Franchi, ended the season with an all time Serie A record of 97 points and an all-time record margin of 22 points over second place Roma.[48] Italian World Cup-winning defender Marco Materazzi scored both goals.[49]\\n\\n\\nInter supporters during the 2010 UEFA Champions League Final at Santiago Bernabéu. In winning the final, Inter became the first and only Italian team to win the treble, having also won the Serie A title and the Coppa Italia.\\nIn this period Inter also reached two times UCL quarter-finals in 2005 and 2006, and UCL round of 16 in 2007: in the last two occasions Inter was eliminated from away goals rules by Villareal and Valencia.\\n\\nInter started the 2007–08 season with the goal of winning both Serie A and Champions League in the year of centenary from the foundation of the club. The team started well in the league, topping the table from the first round of matches, and also managed to qualify for the Champions League knockout stage. However, a late collapse, leading to a 2–0 defeat with ten men away to Liverpool on 19 February in the Champions League,[50] brought manager Roberto Mancini\\'s future at Inter,[51] into question while domestic form took a sharp turn of fortune, with the team failing to win in the three following Serie A games. After being eliminated by Liverpool in the Champions League, Mancini announced his intention to leave his job immediately only to change his mind the following day.[52] On the final day of the 2007–08 Serie A season, Inter played Parma away, that had to win to not be relegated in Serie B after 18 years; Roma scored in Catania and was in the first place until Zlatan Ibrahimović, 10 minutes after have been entered on the pitch in the second half, scored two goals sealed their third consecutive championship.[53][54] Mancini, however, was sacked soon after, due to his previous announcement to leave the club.[55]\\n\\nOn 2 June 2008, Inter appointed former Porto and Chelsea boss José Mourinho as new head coach.[56] In his first season, the Nerazzurri won a Suppercoppa Italiana and a fourth consecutive title, though falling in the Champions League in the first knockout round for a third-straight year, losing to eventual finalist Manchester United.[57] In winning the league title, Inter became the first club in since 1949 to win the title for four consecutive seasons, and joined Torino and Juventus as the only clubs to accomplish this feat, as well as being the first club based outside Turin.\\n\\n\\n\\nJulio Cesar\\nLúcio\\nSamuel\\nMaicon\\nChivu\\nZanetti (C)\\nCambiasso\\nEto\\'o\\nPandev\\nSneijder\\nMilito\\n2010 UEFA Champions League final starting lineup\\nIn the summer of 2009 Inter put foundation to maybe the greatest single season of its history: after have signed Diego Milito and Thiago Motta from Genoa, Lúcio from Bayern Munich, the club agreed to sell Ibrahimovic to Barcelona in change for Samuel Eto\\'o plus 49 millions euros. The transfer session ended with the sign of Wesley Sneijder from Real Madrid in the last days of August. Inter won the 2009–10 Champions League, defeating in round of 16 Ancelotti\\'s Chelsea, Cska Moscow and reigning champions Barcelona in the semi-final, before beating Bayern Munich 2–0 in the final in Madrid, with two goals from Diego Milito.[58] Inter also won the 2009–10 Serie A title by two points over Roma, the fifth consecutive, and the 2010 Coppa Italia by defeating the same side 1–0 in the final.[59] This made Inter the first and only Italian team to win the treble.[60] At the end of the season, Mourinho left the club to manage Real Madrid;[61] he was replaced by Rafael Benítez.\\n\\n\\nDiego Milito scored in Coppa Italia final, in the last Serie A decisive match against Siena and two goals in Champions League final.\\nOn 21 August 2010, Inter defeated Roma 3–1 and won the 2010 Supercoppa Italiana, their fourth trophy of the year.[62] In December 2010, they claimed the FIFA Club World Cup for the first time after a 3–0 win against Mazembe in the final.[63] However, after this win, on 23 December 2010, due to their declining performance in Serie A, the club fired Benítez.[64] He was replaced by Leonardo the following day.[65]\\n\\nLeonardo started with 30 points from 12 games, with an average of 2.5 points per game, better than his predecessors Benítez and Mourinho.[66] On 6 March 2011, Leonardo set a new Italian Serie A record by collecting 33 points in 13 games; the previous record was 32 points in 13 games, made by Fabio Capello in the 2004–05 season.[67] Leonardo led the club to the quarter-finals of the Champions League, after have defeated again Bayern Munich in Round of 16, before losing to Schalke 04;[68] Inter ended second in Serie A and won the Coppa Italia title.[69] At the end of the season, however, he resigned,[70] and was followed by new managers Gian Piero Gasperini, Claudio Ranieri and Andrea Stramaccioni, all hired during the following season.\\n\\nChanges in ownership (2011–2019)\\nOn 1 August 2012, the club announced that Moratti was to sell a minority stake of the club to a Chinese consortium led by Kenneth Huang.[71] On the same day, Inter announced an agreement was formed with China Railway Construction Corporation Limited for a new stadium project, however, the deal with the Chinese eventually collapsed.[72] The 2012–13 season was the worst in recent club history, with Inter finishing ninth in Serie A and failing to qualify for any European competitions. Walter Mazzarri was appointed to replace Stramaccioni as the manager for 2013–14 season on 24 May 2013, having ended his tenure at Napoli.[73] He guided the club to fifth in Serie A and to 2014–15 UEFA Europa League qualification.\\n\\n\\nInter lining up before a Europa League match against Dnipro on 18 September 2014\\nOn 15 October 2013, an Indonesian consortium (International Sports Capital HK Ltd.) led by Erick Thohir, Handy Soetedjo and Rosan Roeslani, signed an agreement to acquire 70% of Inter shares from Internazionale Holding S.r.l.[74][75][76] Immediately after the deal, Moratti\\'s Internazionale Holding S.r.l. still retained 29.5% of the shares of FC Internazionale Milano S.p.A.[77] After the deal, the shares of Inter was owned by a chain of holding companies, namely International Sports Capital S.p.A. of Italy (for 70% stake), International Sports Capital HK Limited and Asian Sports Ventures HK Limited of Hong Kong. Asian Sports Ventures HK Limited, itself another intermediate holding company, was owned by Nusantara Sports Ventures HK Limited (60% stake, a company owned by Thohir), Alke Sports Investment HK Limited (20% stake) and Aksis Sports Capital HK Limited (20% stake).\\n\\nThohir, who also co-owned Major League Soccer (MLS) club D.C. United and Indonesia Super League (ISL) club Persib Bandung, announced on 2 December 2013 that Inter and D.C. United had formed a strategic partnership.[78] During the Thohir era the club began to modify its financial structure from one reliant on continual owner investment to a more self-sustainable business model, although the club still breached UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations in 2015. The club was fined and received a squad reduction in UEFA competitions, with additional penalties suspended during the probation period. During this time, Roberto Mancini returned as the club manager on 14 November 2014, with Inter finishing eighth. Inter finished 2015–2016 season fourth, failing to return to Champions League.\\n\\nOn 6 June 2016, Suning Holdings Group (via a Luxembourg-based subsidiary Great Horizon S.á r.l.) a company owned by Zhang Jindong, co-founder and chairman of Suning Commerce Group, acquired a majority stake of Inter from Thohir\\'s consortium International Sports Capital S.p.A. and from Moratti family\\'s remaining shares in Internazionale Holding S.r.l.[79] According to various filings, the total investment from Suning was €270 million.[80] The deal was approved by an extraordinary general meeting on 28 June 2016, from which Suning Holdings Group had acquired a 68.55% stake in the club.[81]\\n\\nThe first season of new ownership, however, started with poor performance in pre-season friendlies. On 8 August 2016, Inter parted company with head coach Roberto Mancini by mutual consent over disagreements regarding the club\\'s direction,[82] especially with new signings Joao Mario for 44,75 million € (the second most expensive player in club history at that time) and Gabigol for 29,5 million €. He was replaced by Frank de Boer, who was sacked on 1 November 2016 after leading Inter to a 4W–2D–5L record in 11 Serie A games as head coach.[83] The successor, Stefano Pioli, could not prevent the team from getting the worst group result in UEFA competitions in the club\\'s history.[84] Despite an eight-game winning streak, he and the club parted away before season\\'s end, when it became clear they would finish outside the league\\'s top three for the sixth consecutive season.[85] On 9 June 2017, former Roma coach Luciano Spalletti was appointed as Inter manager, signing a two-year contract,[86] and eleven months later Inter secured a UEFA Champions League group stage spot after going six years without Champions League participation, thanks to a 3–2 victory against Lazio in the final game of 2017–18 Serie A.[87][88] Among the best tactical moves from Spalletti there was the change of position for Marcelo Brozovic that become one of the best defensive midfielder in European football.[89][90] Due to this success, in August the club extended the contract with Spalletti to 2021.[91]\\n\\nOn July 4, 2018, Inter officially signed from Racing Club de Avellaneda a 20 years old Argentinian striker Lautaro Martinez for 25 million € that will later become one of the best and most representative player of the club.\\n\\nOn 26 October 2018, Steven Zhang was appointed as new president of the club,[92] and on 13 December 2018 Giuseppe Marotta officially joined Inter Milan as CEO for sport. On 25 January 2019, the club officially announced that LionRock Capital from Hong Kong had reached an agreement with International Sports Capital HK Limited, in order to acquire its 31.05% shares in Inter and to become the club\\'s new minority shareholder.[93] After the 2018–19 Serie A season, despite Inter finishing fourth, Spalletti was sacked.[94]\\n\\nRenewed successes (2019–present)\\n\\nInter players line up before a pre-season friendly against Salzburg in August 2023.\\nOn 31 May 2019, Inter appointed former Juventus and Italian manager Antonio Conte as their new coach, signing a three-year deal;[95] In the summer of 2019 Inter acquired from Manchester United for 74 million € Romelu Lukaku, the new most expensive player in the history of the club, Nicolò Barella for 44,5 million € from Cagliari and sold Mauro Icardi, one of the best striker in Italy in the past years, to PSG for 50 million €.\\n\\nAlessandro Bastoni that was acquired from Atalanta in 2017 for 31,1 million €, made his debut for Inter in this season and with Milan Skriniar and Stefan De Vrij formed a strong defensive trio in a 3-5-2 formation that will be the best defense in Serie A in the following years.\\n\\nIn September 2019, Steven Zhang was elected to the board of the European Club Association.[96] In the 2019–20 Serie A, Inter Milan finished as runner-up, as they won 2–0 against Atalanta on the last matchday.[97] They also reached the 2020 UEFA Europa League final, ultimately losing 3–2 to Sevilla.[98] Inter improved team with signigns of new players, among others in January 2020 Christian Eriksen from Tottenham for 27 million € and in July Achraf Hakimi from Borussia Dortmund for 43 million €.\\n\\nDespite the worst group result in Champions League in the club\\'s history, following Atalanta\\'s draw against Sassuolo on 2 May 2021, Internazionale were confirmed as champions for the first time in eleven years, ending Juventus\\'s run of nine consecutive titles.[99] However, despite securing Serie A glory, Conte left the club by mutual consent on 26 May 2021. The departure was reportedly due to disagreements between Conte and the board over player transfers.[100][101] In June 2021, Simone Inzaghi was appointed as Conte\\'s replacement.[102] On 6 July 2021 Achraf Hakimi was sold to Paris Saint Germain for €60 million and on 8 August 2021, Romelu Lukaku was sold to Chelsea for €115 million, representing the most expensive association football transfer by an Italian football club ever.[103][104]\\n\\nInter qualified in the UCL Round of 16 for the first time in ten years, but despite the club\\'s first ever win at Anfield Road thanks to a goal from Lautaro Martinez, they were eliminated by Liverpool. On 12 January 2022, Inter won the Supercoppa Italiana, defeating Juventus 2–1 at San Siro. After conceding a goal to the opponent, Inter equalised with a penalty scored by Lautaro Martínez, and the match finished 1–1 in regulation time. In the last second of the extra-time, Alexis Sánchez scored the winning goal following a defensive error, giving Inter the first trophy of the season, also Simone Inzaghi\\'s first trophy as Inter manager.[105] On 11 May 2022, Inter won the Coppa Italia, defeating Juventus 4–2 at Stadio Olimpico. After normal time had ended 2–2, with Nicolò Barella and Hakan Çalhanoğlu scoring Inter\\'s goals, Ivan Perišić\\'s brace in the extra-time gave Inter the win and a second title of the season.[106] The 2021–22 Serie A campaign saw Inter finish in second place, being the most prolific attacking side with 84 goals.[107] On 18 January 2023, Inter won the Supercoppa Italiana, defeating Milan 3−0 at King Fahd International Stadium, thanks to goals from Federico Dimarco, Edin Džeko, and Lautaro Martinez.[108]\\n\\nInter passed again UCL group stage after have eliminated Barcelona, and then after have defeated Porto and Benfica, qualified for semifinals of the competition. On 16 May 2023, Inter defeated archrivals Milan in the semi-finals of 2022–23 UEFA Champions League with goals from Dzeko and Henrikh Mkhitaryan in the first leg and a goal from Martinez in the second leg, advanced to the Champions League final for the first time since 2010. However, they were defeated at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium 1−0 by Manchester City after a second half goal from midfielder Rodri.[109]\\n\\nIn January 2024 Inter won its eight Supercoppa Italiana and its third consecutive, in a new format with 4 teams, tying the record set by AC Milan in 90\\'s for consecutive win, after have defeated in Riad Lazio 3–0 and then in the final match Napoli 1–0, with a late goal by Lautaro Martinez.\\n\\nIn July 2023 Inter sold for 50 million € goalkeeper Andre Onana to Manchester United, acquired the prior season for free, like Hakan Calhanoglu in 2021, Henrikh Mkhitaryan in 2022 and Marcus Thuram in 2023. In August 2023 Inter added to the squad also Benjamin Pavard (30 million €) and Yann Sommer (6,9 million €) both from Bayern Munich.\\n\\nOn 22 April 2024, Inter secured their 20th Serie A title and the second Star by defeating Milan 2–1 at the San Siro in a record sixth consecutive Derby della Madonnina win[110] in a dominant season ended with 94 points, 19 over Milan second, the best attack with 89 goals made and the best defense with only 22 goals conceded with +67 difference, the best in Serie A since 1950–1951 season.[111]\\n\\nOn 22 May 2024, Oaktree Capital Management assumed ownership of Inter Milan following the default of Suning Holdings Group on a substantial loan given in May 2021 to the club in order to cover losses incurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.[112] The firm took control of the club after Suning Holdings Group failed to repay a debt of €395 million ($428 million). This development was confirmed by Oaktree in an emailed statement.[113] As a consequence, the new ownership chose to appoint CEO Giuseppe Marotta as the club\\'s new chairman.\\n\\nColours and badge\\n\\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Inter Milan kits.\\n\\n1928–29 S.S. Ambrosiana in its white and red Crociata shirt\\nOne of the founders of Inter, a painter named Giorgio Muggiani, was responsible for the design of the first Inter logo in 1908.[114] The first design incorporated the letters \"FCIM\" in the centre of a series of circles that formed the badge of the club.[114] The basic elements of the design have remained constant even as finer details have been modified over the years. Starting from the 1999–2000 season, the original club crest was reduced in size, to create space for the addition of the club\\'s name and foundation year at the upper and lower part of the logo respectively.[2]\\n\\nIn 2007, the logo was returned to the pre-1999–2000 era.[2] It was given a more modern look with a smaller Scudetto star and lighter colour scheme.[2] This version was used until July 2014, when the club decided to undertake a rebranding.[115] The most significant difference between the current and the previous logo is the omission of the star from other media except match kits.[116]\\n\\nSince its founding in 1908, Inter have almost always worn black and blue stripes, earning them the nickname Nerazzurri. According to the tradition, the colours were adopted to represent the nocturnal sky: in fact, the club was established on the night of 9 March, at 23:30; moreover, blue was chosen by Giorgio Muggiani because he considered it to be the opposite colour to red, worn by the Milan Cricket and Football Club rivals.[117][118]\\n\\nDuring the 1928–29 season, however, Inter were forced by Fascist regime to abandon their black and blue uniforms. In 1928, Inter\\'s name and philosophy made the ruling Fascist Party uneasy; as a result, during the same year the 20-year-old club was merged with Unione Sportiva Milanese: the new club was named Società Sportiva Ambrosiana after the patron saint of Milan.[119] The flag of Milan (the red cross on white background) replaced the traditional black and blue.[120] In 1929, the black-and-blue jerseys were restored, and after World War II, when the Fascists had fallen from power, the club reverted to their original name. In 2008, Inter celebrated their centenary with a red cross on their away shirt. The cross is reminiscent of the flag of their city, and they continue to use the pattern on their third kit. In 2014, the club adopted a predominantly black home kit with thin blue pinstripes[121] before returning to a more traditional design the following season.\\n\\nAnimals are often used to represent football clubs in Italy – the grass snake, called Biscione, represents Inter.[122][123] The snake is a symbol for the city of Milan, appearing often in Milanese heraldry as a coiled viper with a man in its jaws. The symbol is present on the coat of arms of the House of Sforza (which ruled over Italy from Milan during the Renaissance period), the city of Milan, the historical Duchy of Milan (a 400-year state of the Holy Roman Empire) and Insubria (a historical region the city of Milan falls within).[122][123] For the 2010–11 season, Inter\\'s away kit featured the snake.\\n\\n1908–1928\\n1908–1928\\n \\n1963–1979\\n1963–1979\\n \\n1998–2007\\n1998–2007\\n \\n2007–2014\\n2007–2014\\n \\n2014–2021\\n2014–2021\\n \\n2021–present\\n2021–present\\nStadium\\nMain article: San Siro\\nSee also: Arena Civica\\n\\nSan Siro during an Inter match\\nThe team\\'s stadium is the 75,923 seat San Siro,[10] officially known as the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza after the former player who represented for 14 seasons Inter and for two Milan. The more commonly used name, San Siro, is the name of the district where it is located. San Siro has been the home of Milan since 1926, when it was privately built by funding from Milan\\'s chairman at the time, Piero Pirelli. Construction was performed by 120 workers, and took 13+1⁄2 months to complete. The stadium was owned by the club until it was sold to the city in 1935, and since 1947 it has been shared with Inter, when they were accepted as joint tenant.\\n\\nThe first game played at the stadium was on 19 September 1926, when Inter beat Milan 6–3 in a friendly match. Milan played its first league game in San Siro on 19 September 1926, losing 1–2 to Sampierdarenese. From an initial capacity of 35,000 spectators, the stadium has undergone several major renovations. A major structural renovation was made for the 2016 UEFA Champions League Final while another one took place in late 2021 to host the UEFA Nations League final. The stadium is going to be refurbished again in time for Milano Cortina 2026.[124]\\n\\nBased on the English model for stadiums, San Siro is specifically designed for football matches, as opposed to many multi-purpose stadiums used in Serie A. It is therefore renowned in Italy for its atmosphere during matches, owing to the closeness of the stands to the pitch.\\n\\nNew Milano Stadium\\nSince 2012, various proposals and projects by Massimo Moratti have alternated regarding a possible construction of a new Inter stadium. [125] Between June and July 2019, Inter and Milan announced the agreement for the construction of a new shared stadium in the San Siro area.[126] In the winter of 2021, Giuseppe Sala, the mayor of Milan, gave official permission for the construction of the new stadium next to San Siro, which is expected to be partially demolished and refunctionalised after the 2026 Olympic Games.[127] In early 2022, Inter and Milan revealed a \"plan B\" to relocate the construction of the new Milano stadium in the Greater Milan, away from the San Siro area.[128]\\n\\nSupporters and rivalries\\nMain articles: Derby della Madonnina and Derby d\\'Italia\\nInter is the second most supported club in Italy, according to an August 2024 research by Ipsos.[129] In the early years (until the First World War), Inter fans from the city of Milan were typically middle class, while Milan fans were typically working class.[118] During Massimo Moratti\\'s ownership, Inter fans were considered to be on the moderate left. At the same time, during Silvio Berlusconi\\'s reign, Milan fans were viewed as belonging to the centre-right.\\n\\nThe traditional ultras group of Inter is Boys San; which are one of the oldest Italian ultras groups, being founded in 1969. Politically, one group (Irriducibili) of Inter Ultras are right-wing and this group has relations with the Lazio ultras. As well as the main group (apolitical) of Boys San, there are five more significant groups: Viking (apolitical), Irriducibili (right-wing), Ultras (apolitical), Brianza Alcoolica (apolitical) and Imbastisci (left-wing).\\n\\nInter\\'s most vocal fans gather in the Curva Nord, or north curve of the San Siro. This longstanding tradition has led to the Curva Nord being synonymous with the club\\'s most die-hard supporters, who unfurl banners and wave flags in support of their team. Throughout 2024, the Curva Nord (labelled as the \"Curva Nord Milano\") have collaborated with rap duo ¥$ (composed of Kanye West and Ty Dolla Sign) on multiple occasions, appearing as a choir on the chart-topping hit song \"Carnival\" (alongside rapping on its chorus) featuring Playboi Carti and Rich the Kid and on the ¥$ remix of \"Like That\" featuring only Future and record producer Metro Boomin (Kendrick Lamar would not appear on the remixed version of the song).[130][131]\\n\\n\\nScene of a Derby della Madonnina in 1915\\nInter have several rivalries, two of which are highly significant in Italian football; firstly, they participate in the intracity Derby della Madonnina with Milan; the rivalry has existed ever since Inter splintered off from Milan in 1908.[118] The name of the derby refers to the Blessed Virgin Mary atop the Milan Cathedral. The match usually creates a lively atmosphere, with numerous (often humorous or offensive) banners unfolded before the match. Flares are commonly present, but they also led to the abandonment of the second leg of the 2004–05 Champions League quarter-final matchup between Milan and Inter on 12 April, after a flare thrown from the crowd by an Inter supporter struck Milan keeper Dida on the shoulder.[132]\\n\\nThe other principal rivalry is with Juventus; matches between the two clubs are known as the Derby d\\'Italia. Up until the 2006 Italian football scandal, which saw Juventus relegated, the two were the only Italian clubs never to have played below Serie A. In the 2000s, Inter developed a rivalry with Roma, who finished as runners-up to Inter in all but one of Inter\\'s five Scudetto-winning seasons between 2005–06 and 2009–10. The two sides have also contested in five Coppa Italia finals and four Supercoppa Italiana finals since 2006. Other clubs, like Atalanta and Napoli, are also considered among their rivals.[133] Their supporters collectively go by Interisti, or Nerazzurri.[134]\\n\\nHonours\\n\\nThe Inter team which won the Intercontinental Cup in 1965\\nMain articles: List of Inter Milan seasons, List of Inter Milan honours, and Inter Milan in European football\\nInter have won 37 domestic trophies, including the Serie A twenty times, the Coppa Italia nine times and the Supercoppa Italiana eight times. From 2006 to 2010, the club won five successive league titles, equalling the all-time record before 2017, when Juventus won their sixth successive league title.[8] They have won the UEFA Champions League three times: two back-to-back in 1964 and 1965 and then another in 2010; the last completed an unprecedented Italian treble with the Coppa Italia and the Scudetto.[9] The club has also won three UEFA Europa League, two Intercontinental Cup and one FIFA Club World Cup.\\n\\nInter has never been relegated from the top flight of Italian football in its entire existence. It is the sole club to have competed in Serie A and its predecessors in every season since its debut in 1909.',\n",
       " 'Read Madrid CF': 'Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (Spanish pronunciation: [reˈal maˈðɾið ˈkluβ ðe ˈfuðβol] ⓘ), commonly referred to as Real Madrid, is a Spanish professional football club based in Madrid. The club competes in La Liga, the top tier of Spanish football.\\n\\nFounded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since its inception. The honorific title real is Spanish for \"royal\" and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 along with the crown in the club crest. Real Madrid have played their home matches in the 85,000-capacity Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting clubs, Real Madrid\\'s members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout its history. The official Madrid anthem is the \"Hala Madrid y nada más\", written by RedOne and Manuel Jabois.[8] The club is one of the most widely supported in the world and is the most followed football club on social media according to the CIES Football Observatory as of 2024.[9][10] It was estimated to be worth $6.6 billion in 2024, making it the world\\'s most valuable football club.[11] In 2024, Real Madrid became the first football club to make €1 billion ($1.08bn) in revenue according to the club\\'s announcement.[12]\\n\\nReal Madrid are one of the most successful football clubs in the world and most successful in Europe. In domestic football, the club has won 71 trophies; a record 36 La Liga titles, 20 Copa del Rey, 13 Supercopa de España, a Copa Eva Duarte and a Copa de la Liga.[13] In International football, Real Madrid have won a record 35 trophies: a record 15 European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, a record six UEFA Super Cups, two UEFA Cups, a joint record two Latin Cups, a record one Iberoamerican Cup, and a record nine FIFA Club World championships.[note 1] Madrid was ranked joint first a record number of times in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for the years 2000, 2002, 2014, 2017, and 2024.[17] In UEFA, Madrid ranks first in the all-time club ranking.[18][19]\\n\\nBeing one of the three founding members of La Liga that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929 (along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona), Real Madrid has many long-standing rivalries, most notably El Clásico with Barcelona and El Derbi Madrileño with Atlético Madrid. The club established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five consecutive and six overall European Cups and reaching a further two finals. This success was replicated on the domestic front, with Madrid winning 12 league titles in 16 years. This team, which included Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, Paco Gento and Raymond Kopa is considered, by some in the sport, to be the greatest of all time.[20][21] Real Madrid is known for its Galácticos policy, which involves signing the world\\'s best players, such as Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane and David Beckham to create a superstar team.[22] The term \\'Galácticos policy\\' generally refers to the two eras of Florentino Pérez\\'s presidency of the club (2000–2006 and 2009–2018); however, players brought in just before his tenure are sometimes considered to be part of the Galácticos legacy. A notable example is Steve McManaman, who like many other players also succeeded under the policy.[23] On 26 June 2009, Madrid signed Cristiano Ronaldo for a record-breaking £80 million (€94 million);[24] he became both the club\\'s and history\\'s all-time top goalscorer.[25][26][27][28] Madrid have recently focused on signing young talents such as Vinícius Júnior, Rodrygo, and Jude Bellingham.[29]\\n\\nReal Madrid is recognised as the greatest football club of the 20th century by FIFA and as the best European club during the same timeframe by the IFFHS,[30] while also receiving the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit in 2004.[31] Real Madrid has the highest participations in the European Cup/Champions League (55),[18] a tournament in which they hold the overall record for the most wins, most draws and most goals scored.[32] Real Madrid is the only club to have won three consecutive titles (three-peat) in the European Cup/Champions League twice, first in 1955–56, 1956–57, and 1957–58, and second in 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18 and was the first and the only club to win La Decima (in 2013–14).[33] In June 2024, they won a record-extending 15th Champions League title (the sixth in eleven seasons), recognised as such by Guinness World Records.[34] Real Madrid is the first club across all of Europe\\'s top-five leagues to win 100 trophies in all competitions.[35] As of February 2025, Real Madrid are ranked 1st in Europe, according to the UEFA club rankings as well as first in last 10 years (2013–2023) overall.[36][37]\\n\\nHistory\\nMain article: History of Real Madrid CF\\nSee also: List of Real Madrid CF seasons\\nEarly years (1902–1943)\\n\\nJulián Palacios, the first president of the club in 1900–1902\\nReal Madrid\\'s origins go back to when football was introduced to Madrid by the academics and students of the Institución Libre de Enseñanza, which included several Cambridge and Oxford University graduates.[38] They founded (Sociedad) Sky Football in 1897, commonly known as La Sociedad (The Society) as it was the only one based in Madrid, playing on Sunday mornings at Moncloa.\\n\\nIn 1900, conflict between members caused some of them to leave and create a new club, Nueva Sociedad de Football (New Society of Football), to distinguish themselves from Sky Football. Among the dissenters were Julián Palacios, recognized as the first Real Madrid president, Juan Padrós and Carlos Padrós, the latter two being brothers and future presidents of Real Madrid. In 1901, this new club was renamed as Madrid Football Club. Later, following a restructuring in 1902, Sky was renamed as \"New Foot-Ball Club\".[39][40][41]\\n\\nOn 6 March 1902, after a new board presided by Juan Padrós had been elected, Madrid Football Club was officially founded.[7] The Padrós brothers summoned other football enthusiasts to a meeting in the back room of Al Capricho, the family business. They viewed football as a mass sport that should be accessible to representatives of all social classes, and thought the new club should embody that idea. The brothers proposed the name, Madrid Football Club, which was unanimously accepted. The membership fee was also set, two pesetas a month, and the color of the shirt was chosen to be white in honour of a famous English team Corinthian, which Juan Padrós had met on one of his trips.[42][43]\\n\\n\\nMadrid FC team in 1906\\nThree years after its founding, in 1905, Madrid FC won its first title after defeating Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Cup final. The club became one of the founding sides of the Royal Spanish Football Federation on 4 January 1909, when club president Adolfo Meléndez signed the foundation agreement of the Spanish FA. After moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the Campo de O\\'Donnell in 1912.[44] In 1920, the club\\'s name was changed to Real Madrid after King Alfonso XIII granted the title of Real (Royal) to the club.[45]\\n\\nIn 1929, the first Spanish football league was founded. Real Madrid led the first league season until the last match, a loss to Athletic Bilbao, meant they finished runners-up to Barcelona.[46] Real Madrid won its first league title in the 1931–32 season and retained it the following year.[47]\\n\\nOn 14 April 1931, the arrival of the Second Spanish Republic caused the club to lose the title Real and the royal crown on its emblem, going back to being named Madrid Football Club until the end of the Spanish Civil War. Football continued during the Second World War, and on 13 June 1943, Madrid beat Barcelona 11–1 in the second leg of the Copa del Generalísimo semi-finals, the Spanish Cup having been renamed in honour of General Franco.[note 2][48]\\n\\nThe first leg, played at the Les Corts in Catalonia, had ended with Barcelona winning 3–0. Madrid complained about all the three goals that referee Fombona Fernández had allowed for Barcelona,[49] with the home supporters also whistling Madrid throughout, whom they accused of employing roughhouse tactics, and Fombona for allowing them to. The newspaper Ya reported the whistling as a \"clear intention to attack the representatives of Spain.\"[50] Barcelona fans were banned from traveling to Madrid. The day of the second leg, the Barcelona team were insulted and stones were thrown at their bus as soon as they left their hotel.\\n\\nBarcelona\\'s striker Mariano Gonzalvo said of the incident, \"Five minutes before the game had started, our penalty area was already full of coins.\" Barcelona goalkeeper Luis Miró rarely approached his line—when he did, he was armed with stones. As Francisco Calvet told the story, \"They were shouting: Reds! Separatists!... a bottle just missed Sospedra that would have killed him if it had hit him. It was all set up.\"[51]\\n\\nReal Madrid went 2–0 up within half an hour. The third goal brought with it a sending off for Barcelona\\'s Benito García after he made what Calvet claimed was a \"completely normal tackle\". Madrid\\'s José Llopis Corona recalled: \"At which point, they got a bit demoralized,\" while Ángel Mur countered, \"at which point, we thought: \\'go on then, score as many as you want\\'.\"[52] Madrid made it 8–0 by half-time; two goals were also ruled out for offside, and proceeded to score a further three goals in the second half, to which Barcelona replied with a late consolation goal.[53]\\n\\nAccording to football writer Sid Lowe, \"There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11–1 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona\\'s history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims.\"[49] Fernando Argila, Barcelona\\'s reserve goalkeeper from the 1943 match, said: \"There was no rivalry. Not, at least, until that game.\"[54]\\n\\nSantiago Bernabéu and unprecedented success (1943–1978)\\n\\nAlfredo Di Stéfano led the club to win five consecutive European Cups (currently the Champions League).\\nSantiago Bernabéu became president of Real Madrid in 1943.[55] Under his presidency, the club was rebuilt after the Civil War, and he oversaw the construction of the club\\'s current stadium, Estadio Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (now known as the Santiago Bernabéu), and its training facilities Ciudad Deportiva. Additionally, during the 1950s former Real Madrid Amateurs player Miguel Malbo founded Real Madrid\\'s youth academy, or \"cantera,\" known today as La Fábrica. Beginning in 1953, he embarked upon a strategy of signing world-class players from abroad, the most prominent being Alfredo Di Stéfano.[56]\\n\\n\\nAmancio Amaro, captain of the Yé-yé team of the 1960s\\nIn 1955, acting upon the idea proposed by Gabriel Hanot, a French sports journalist and editor of L\\'Équipe, Bernabéu, Ernest Bedrignan (deputy chairman of the Ligue de Football Professionnel)[57] and Gusztáv Sebes created the European Cup, a continental tournament for the league champions around Europe, which is today known as the UEFA Champions League.[58] It was under Bernabéu\\'s guidance that Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football. The club won the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included the 7–3 Hampden Park final against Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960.[56] After these five consecutive successes, Real was permanently awarded the original cup and earned the right to wear the UEFA badge of honour.[59] Real Madrid\\'s achievements in Europe were built upon its unprecedented domestic dominance, with the club winning twelve league titles out of sixteen possible from 1953–54 to 1968–69, including a five-in-a-row sequence in 1961–65, and finishing runners-up a further three times.[60]\\n\\n\\nReal Madrid\\'s captain Paco Gento shaking hands with Zamalek\\'s captain Sharif El-Far before their friendly match on the occasion for celebrating 50 years on Zamalek\\'s establishment in Cairo Stadium on 10 March 1961\\nThe club won the European Cup for a sixth time in 1966, defeating Partizan Belgrade 2–1 in the final with a team composed entirely of same nationality players, a first in the competition.[61] This team became known as the Yé-yé. The name \"Yé-yé\" came from the \"Yeah, yeah, yeah\" chorus in The Beatles\\' song \"She Loves You\" after four members of the team posed for Marca and impersonated the Beatles.[62] The Yé-yé generation was also European Cup runners-up in 1962[63] and 1964.[61] In the 1970s, Real Madrid won six league championships and three Spanish Cups.[64] The club competed in its first European Cup Winners\\' Cup in 1970–71 and progressed all the way to the final, where it lost to English side Chelsea 2–1 in a replay.[65] On 2 July 1978, club president Santiago Bernabéu died while the World Cup was being played in Argentina. FIFA decreed three days of mourning to honour him during the tournament.[66] The following year, the club organized the first edition of the Trofeo Santiago Bernabéu in memory of its former president.\\n\\nBernabéu had been Real Madrid\\'s president for almost 35 years, during which his club won one Intercontinental Cup, six European Cups, 16 league titles, six Spanish Cups, two Latin Cups and one Copa Eva Duarte.[67]\\n\\nQuinta del Buitre and sustained success (1980–2000)\\n\\n\\nCasillas\\nHelguera\\nKaranka\\nCampo\\nSalgado\\nRoberto Carlos\\nMcManaman\\nRedondo (C)\\nAnelka\\nRaúl\\nMorientes\\n2000 UEFA Champions League Final starting lineup\\nIn the early 1980s, Real Madrid had lost its grasp on the La Liga title, until a new cohort of home-grown stars brought domestic success back to the club.[68][69] Spanish sports journalist Julio César Iglesias gave to this generation the name La Quinta del Buitre (\"Vulture\\'s Cohort\"), which was derived from the nickname given to one of its members, Emilio Butragueño. The other four members were Manolo Sanchís, Martín Vázquez, Míchel and Miguel Pardeza. All five footballers were graduates of Real Madrid\\'s youth academy.[68][69] With La Quinta del Buitre (reduced to four members when Pardeza left for Zaragoza in 1986) and notable players like goalkeeper Francisco Buyo, right-back Miguel Porlán Chendo and Mexican striker Hugo Sánchez, Real Madrid had one of the best teams in Spain and Europe during the second half of the 1980s, winning two UEFA Cups, five Spanish championships in a row, one Spanish Cup, and three Spanish Super Cups.[68][69] In the early 1990s, La Quinta del Buitre split up after Martín Vázquez, Emilio Butragueño and Míchel left the club.\\n\\nIn 1996, President Lorenzo Sanz appointed Fabio Capello as coach.[70] Although his tenure lasted only one season, Real Madrid were proclaimed league champions, and players like Predrag Mijatović, Davor Šuker, Clarence Seedorf, Roberto Carlos and keeper Bodo Illgner arrived at the club to strengthen a squad that already boasted the likes of Raúl, Fernando Hierro and Fernando Redondo. As a result, Real Madrid (with the addition of Fernando Morientes in 1997) finally ended its 32-year wait for its seventh European Cup: in 1998, under manager Jupp Heynckes, they defeated Juventus 1–0 in the final with a goal from Mijatović.[71]\\n\\nIn November 1999, Vicente del Bosque took over as coach. For the last season of the century, 1999–2000, the squad was still led by the older veterans such as Fernando Hierro, Fernando Redondo, Roberto Carlos and Raúl. Real added the budding young talents of Guti and Iker Casillas, supported by the arrival of Steve McManaman and Nicolas Anelka from the English Premier League, alongside local talents Míchel Salgado and Iván Helguera. In Del Bosque\\'s first season in charge, Real won the Champions League for the eighth time, following a 3–0 victory over Valencia in the final, with goals from Morientes, McManaman and Raúl.[72] This victory marked the beginning of a successful period in Real Madrid\\'s history.[73]\\n\\nFlorentino Pérez era (2000–2006)\\nSee also: Galácticos\\n\\n\\nCésar\\nHierro (c)\\nHelguera\\nSalgado\\nRoberto Carlos\\nMakélélé\\nFigo\\nSolari\\nZidane\\nRaúl\\nMorientes\\n2002 UEFA Champions League Final starting lineup\\nIn July 2000, Florentino Pérez was elected club president.[74] He vowed in his campaign to erase the club\\'s €270 million debt and modernize the club\\'s facilities. However, the primary electoral promise that propelled Pérez to victory was the signing of Luís Figo from arch-rivals Barcelona.[75] The following year, the club had its training ground rezoned and used the money to begin assembling the Galácticos team by signing a global star every summer, which included Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Luís Figo, David Beckham and Fabio Cannavaro.[76] It is debatable whether the gamble paid off, as despite winning the UEFA Champions League and an Intercontinental Cup in 2002, followed by La Liga in 2003, the club failed to win a major trophy for the next three seasons. Off the pitch, the Zidanes y Pavones policy resulted in increased financial success based on the exploitation of the club\\'s high marketing potential around the world, particularly in Asia.[77]\\n\\n\\nBeckham and Zidane were considered Galácticos.\\nThe few days after the capturing of the 2003 La Liga title were surrounded with controversy. The first controversial decision came when Pérez sacked winning coach Vicente del Bosque.[78] Over a dozen players left the club, including Madrid captain Fernando Hierro, while defensive midfielder Claude Makélélé refused to take part in training in protest at being one of the lowest-paid players at the club and subsequently moved to Chelsea.[79] \"That\\'s a lot [of players leaving] when the normal rule is: never change a winning team,\" stated Zidane.[80] Real Madrid, with newly appointed coach Carlos Queiroz, started their domestic league slowly after a hard win over Real Betis.[80]\\n\\nThe 2005–06 season began with the promise of several new signings: Júlio Baptista (€24 million), Robinho (€30 million), and Sergio Ramos (€27 million).[81] However, Real Madrid suffered from some poor results, including a 0–3 loss at the hands of Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu in November 2005.[82] Madrid\\'s coach Wanderley Luxemburgo was sacked the following month and his replacement was Juan Ramón López Caro.[83] A brief return to form came to an abrupt halt after Madrid lost the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-finals 6–1 to Real Zaragoza,[84] a defeat that was nearly reversed with a 4–0 home victory. Shortly after, Real Madrid were eliminated from the Champions League for a fourth successive year, this time at the hands of Arsenal. On 27 February 2006, Florentino Pérez resigned.[85]\\n\\nRamón Calderón era (2006–2009)\\nRamón Calderón was elected as club president on 2 July 2006 and subsequently appointed Fabio Capello as the new coach and Predrag Mijatović as the new sporting director. Real Madrid won the Liga title in 2007 for the first time in four years, but Capello was nonetheless sacked at the end of the campaign.[86] The title was won on 17 June, where Real faced Mallorca at the Bernabéu while Barcelona and Sevilla, the other title challengers, faced Gimnàstic de Tarragona and Villarreal, respectively. At half-time, Real were 0–1 down, while Barcelona had surged ahead into a 0–3 lead in Tarragona. However, three goals in the last half-hour secured Madrid a 3–1 win and their first league title since 2003.[87] Real Madrid repeated as league winners in 2007–08, but the following season ended up being one of the most disastrous in the club\\'s history: Real was knocked out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage for the fifth time in a row, losing to Liverpool 0–5 on aggregate, and was embarrassed by Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu with a humiliating 2–6 loss, which all but confirmed the league title for Barça that went on to win the treble.[88]\\n\\nSecond Florentino Pérez era (2009–present)\\n\\nCristiano Ronaldo was the club\\'s most expensive signing when he joined in 2009, costing €94 million. He went on to become the club\\'s all-time top scorer.\\nOn 1 June 2009, Florentino Pérez regained Real Madrid\\'s presidency amid the outrage over the club\\'s decline.[89][90] Pérez continued with the Galácticos policy pursued in his first term, buying Kaká from Milan for a record-breaking (in pounds sterling) sum of £56 million,[91] and then breaking the record again by purchasing Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United for £80 million.[92] Real Madrid spent in excess of €261 million in the summer of 2009, and the assembled team was soon dubbed the Second Galácticos.[93] The 2009–10 season, however, was a transitional one as Madrid again finished second in the league, although this time amassing 96 points, the club\\'s record at the time, and went out of the Champions League at the hands of Lyon. The season was marred by Cristiano Ronaldo\\'s injury, that sidelined him for seven weeks,[94] although he still topped the goalscoring charts with 33 goals, and Madrid became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals. Real Madrid also had the misfortune to become the runners-up with the highest points total in the history of Europe\\'s top five leagues, until surpassed by Liverpool\\'s 97 points in 2018–19.[95][96]\\n\\nJosé Mourinho took over as manager in May 2010.[97][98] In the 2010–11 season, the rebuilt Madrid successfully fought on all fronts, going toe to toe with a brilliant Barcelona side which some regard as the greatest team in football history. Ultimately, Madrid finished second in the league, with 92 points and four behind their perennial rivals, defeated them in the Copa del Rey final, and lost to Barça in the Champions League semi-finals, where Real progressed to for the first time since 2002–03. Moreover, from 16 April through 3 May, a rare occurrence happened when, for the first time ever, four Clásicos were to be played in a span of just 18 days. The first fixture was in the league campaign on 16 April (which ended 1–1 with penalty goals for both sides), the second one was in the Copa del Rey final (which was won by Madrid 1–0 a.e.t., bringing them their first trophy in the second Galáctico era) on 20 April and the third and fourth ones in the controversial[99][100] two-legged Champions League semi-finals on 27 April and 3 May (Barcelona won on aggregate with a 2–0 away victory and a 1–1 home draw).[101] Madrid again became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals, repeating its output from the previous season, with Ronaldo scoring 40 and winning the European Golden Shoe.\\n\\nIn the 2011–12 season, Real Madrid won La Liga for a record 32nd time in its history, also finishing the season with numerous league records set, including 100 points amassed in a single season, a total of 121 goals scored, a goal difference of +89, 16 away games won, and 32 wins overall.[102] They also competed in the UEFA Champions League for the 15th successive season,[103] losing in the semi-finals to Bayern Munich in a penalty shoot-out after a 3–3 aggregate tie. Madrid entered the Copa del Rey as the defending champions, but lost 3–4 on aggregate in the quarter-finals to Barcelona. In the same season, Cristiano Ronaldo became the fastest player to reach 100 goals scored in Spanish league history. In reaching 101 goals in 92 games, Ronaldo surpassed Real Madrid legend Ferenc Puskás, who scored 100 goals in 105 matches. Ronaldo set a new club mark for individual goals scored in one year (60) and became the first player ever to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single season.[104][105]\\n\\nReal Madrid started the 2012–13 season by winning the Supercopa de España, defeating Barcelona on away goals. However, the super cup turned out to be their only trophy of the season, despite being close to win them all. Real finished runners-up to Barça in La Liga, accumulating 85 points, and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League for the third year in a row, where they were eliminated by Borussia Dortmund 3–4 on aggregate. Madrid also entered the Copa del Rey in the round of 32, going on a memorable run to the final, which saw them defeat Barcelona in the semi-finals before losing to Atlético Madrid 1–2 a.e.t. Real Madrid faced the Blaugrana six times throughout the season, coming away with three wins, two draws, and one loss. A major transfer of the season was the signing of Luka Modrić from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in the region of £33 million.[106] After a loss to Atlético in the Copa del Rey final, Pérez announced the departure of José Mourinho at the end of the season by \"mutual agreement\".[107]\\n\\nLa Décima and Champions League dominance\\n\\n\\nCasillas (C)\\nRamos\\nVarane\\nCarvajal\\nCoentrão\\nKhedira\\nModrić\\nDi María\\nBale\\nRonaldo\\nBenzema\\n2014 UEFA Champions League Final starting lineup, with a front three of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo (dubbed BBC)\\n\\nReal Madrid players celebrate the club\\'s historic tenth European Cup / Champions League win (La Décima) in 2014.\\nOn 25 June 2013, Carlo Ancelotti succeeded Mourinho to become the manager of Real Madrid on a three-year deal, with Zinedine Zidane named as one of his assistants.[108] On 1 September 2013, the long-awaited transfer of Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur was announced. The transfer of the Welshman was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer price approximated at €100 million.[109] In Ancelotti\\'s first season at the club, Real Madrid fought on all three fronts for the continental treble. Despite leading in the league campaign on multiple occasions, Madrid ultimately finished in third place (level on points with Barcelona and three behind cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid), collecting 87 points in total and scoring a record 104 goals.[110] By that time, Los Blancos had already secured the Copa del Rey – against rivals Barcelona – in April, with Bale scoring the winner.[111] The major breakthrough came in the UEFA Champions League, where Real returned to the final after twelve years, having beaten defending champions Bayern Munich 5–0 on aggregate in the semi-finals.[112] In the final, they defeated then-recently-league winners Atlético Madrid 4–1 a.e.t. to clinch their tenth European Cup (first since 2002) and become the first team to win ten European Cups/Champions League titles, an achievement known as \"La Décima\" (Spanish: \"The Tenth,\" [la ˈðeθima]).[113] Real\\'s attacking trio of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, dubbed the BBC, finished the season with 97 goals.[114]\\n\\nAfter winning the 2014 Champions League, Real Madrid signed goalkeeper Keylor Navas, midfielder Toni Kroos and attacking midfielder James Rodríguez.[115] In August, Madrid won the 2014 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, the club\\'s 79th official trophy.[116] During the last week of the 2014 summer transfer window, Real Madrid sold two players key to the previous season\\'s successes: Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich and Ángel Di María to Manchester United. This decision by the club was surrounded by controversy, with Cristiano Ronaldo stating, \"If I was in charge, maybe I would have done things differently,\" while Carlo Ancelotti admitted, \"We must start again from zero.\"[117]\\n\\nAfter a slow start to the 2014–15 season, Real Madrid went on a record-breaking 22-match winning streak, which included wins against Barcelona and Liverpool, surpassing the previous Spanish record of 18 successive wins set by Frank Rijkaard\\'s Barça in the 2005–06 season.[118] In late December, Real Madrid won their first Club World Cup, defeating San Lorenzo 2–0 in the final.[119] The winning streak came to an end in their opening match of 2015 with a loss to Valencia, leaving the club two short of equalling the world record of 24 consecutive wins.[120] Madrid was in contention for both the La Liga title and the UEFA Champions League until the end but ultimately came up short, finishing with 92 points in the league, two behind treble-winning Barcelona and losing to Juventus 2–3 on aggregate in the Champions League semi-finals.[121] Ronaldo finished the season scoring 48 league goals, winning his fourth European Golden Shoe, and 61 goals in all competitions, breaking his record from 2011 to 2012.[122] Overall, despite playing an attractive attacking football and being the highest scoring team in Europe with 118 league goals,[123] several narrow defeats meant that Real finished the season with two trophies out of six possible, which contributed to the dismissal of Carlo Ancelotti on 25 May 2015.[124][125]\\n\\nOn 3 June 2015, Rafael Benítez was confirmed as the new Real Madrid manager for the 2015–16 season, signing a three-year contract.[126] Real Madrid remained unbeaten in the league until a 3–2 loss at Sevilla on the matchday 11. This was followed by a 0–4 home loss in the first Clásico of the season against Barcelona. Perhaps, his reign is best remembered by multiple lopsided wins achieved both in La Liga and the Champions League (6–0 vs Espanyol, 8–0 vs Malmö, 10–2 vs Rayo Vallecano and others). In the Copa del Rey round of 32, Real accidentally fielded an ineligible player in a 3–1 first leg win at Cádiz and was disqualified from the tournament two days later by the competition judge, despite protests from president Pérez.[127][128][129] In the meantime, Madrid comfortably topped their UCL group with 16 points and a +16 goal difference. Benítez was relieved of his duties on 4 January 2016 following allegations of unpopularity with supporters, displeasure with players and a failure to produce good results against top teams.[130] Benítez\\'s departure was announced along with the promotion of Zinedine Zidane to his first head coaching role.[131] Under Zidane, Madrid managed to turn the odds in its favour, ultimately winning the Champions League, something no one expected. The notable results include a 2–1 away victory over reigning treble winners Barcelona, who were on a record-breaking winning streak, a fantastic comeback against Wolfsburg in the Champions League quarter-finals (after losing the away game 0–2, Madrid erased the deficit and won 3–0 at home, courtesy of a Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick), as well as a 12-game winning streak to conclude the league campaign, meaning Real finished second, with 90 points and just one point behind champions Barcelona, coming agonizingly close to clinching the title and overcoming a 12-point deficit in the process.[132] Finally, on 28 May, Real Madrid\\'s eleventh Champions League title was won thanks to a 5–3 penalty shoot-out victory over rivals Atlético Madrid after a 1–1 draw in the final, with the achievement being termed \"La Undécima\".[133][134][125]\\n\\n\\n2016–17 La Liga champions Real Madrid celebrate the title with Community of Madrid President Cristina Cifuentes.\\nReal Madrid began their 2016–17 campaign, which was to be Zidane\\'s first full season in charge of the club, with a victory in the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla.[135] On 10 December 2016, Madrid played their 35th-straight match without a loss, which set a new club record.[136] On 18 December 2016, the club defeated Japanese outfit Kashima Antlers 4–2 in the final of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup.[137] With a 3–3 draw at Sevilla in the second leg of the Copa del Rey round of 16 on 12 January 2017, Madrid progressed to the quarter-finals with a 6–3 aggregate victory and extended its unbeaten run to 40 matches, breaking Barcelona\\'s Spanish record of 39 matches unbeaten in all competitions from the previous season.[138] Their unbeaten streak ended after a 1–2 away loss against the same opposition in La Liga three days later.[139] The team then was knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Celta Vigo 3–4 on aggregate. These slips, however, did not affect the overall trajectory of the season. In May, Madrid won the league title for a record 33rd time, their first title in five years, accumulating 93 points in the process.[140] On 3 June 2017, the club\\'s victory over Juventus in the Champions League final resulted in Real Madrid becoming the first team to successfully defend their title in the UEFA Champions League era, and the first to win consecutive titles in the competition since Milan in 1989 and 1990, when the tournament was known as the European Cup.[141][142] Real Madrid\\'s title was its 12th, extending the record, and its third in four years. The achievement is also known as \"La Duodécima\".[143] The 2016–17 season was the greatest campaign in terms of trophies won (four out of possible five) in the history of Real Madrid, an achievement that would be later equalled in the 2017–18 season.[144]\\n\\nReal kicked off the 2017–18 campaign by winning its second consecutive and fourth overall UEFA Super Cup in a 2–1 victory against Manchester United.[145] Five days later, Real Madrid beat Barcelona at the Camp Nou 3–1 in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de España and then defeated Barça 2–0 in the return leg, ending their 24 consecutive match scoring record in El Clásico matches and winning the second trophy of the season.[146] On 16 December 2017, Real beat Brazilian club Grêmio 1–0 in the FIFA Club World Cup final and became the first team to retain the trophy.[147] In the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, Madrid once again progressed to the final where they defeated Liverpool 3–1 to become the first club to win three straight titles in the Champions League era, as well as the first team to win three consecutive titles in the European Cup/Champions League since Bayern Munich in 1976. The trophy also marked Madrid\\'s fourth win in five years and their eighth consecutive semi-finals appearance. On 31 May, only five days after winning the final, Zidane announced his resignation as Real Madrid manager, citing the club\\'s \"need for change\" as his rationale for departing.[148][149] Zidane\\'s and Ronaldo\\'s departures marked the end of the Second Galáctico Era that yielded four Champions League titles, two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, two Supercopa de España, three UEFA Super Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cup titles. The team was instrumental in ending Barcelona\\'s dominance, despite the Blaugrana boasting arguably the greatest collection of talent in history,[150] and overshadowed the Catalans on the European stage.[151] Real Madrid was also somewhat notoriously unlucky in its league campaigns throughout these nine years, finishing runners-up with 96, 92 (twice) and 90 points, as well as on 87 points in third place, just three off the league winners.[96]\\n\\nFollowing Ronaldo\\'s departure\\n\\nChart of Real Madrid\\'s league performance 1929–2024\\nOn 12 June 2018, Real Madrid named Julen Lopetegui, the head coach of the Spanish national team, as their new manager. It was announced that he would officially begin his managerial duties after the 2018 FIFA World Cup. However, the Spanish national team sacked Lopetegui a day prior to the tournament, stating that he had negotiated terms with the club without informing them.[152][153] The club then began re-shaping the squad in the summer of 2018, which included the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus for a reported €117 million.[154] Madrid began their 2018–19 campaign by losing to Atlético Madrid 2–4 a.e.t. in the 2018 UEFA Super Cup. After a 1–5 loss to Barcelona in El Clásico on 28 October which left Real Madrid in the ninth place with only 14 points after ten games, Lopetegui was dismissed a day later and replaced by then Castilla coach, Santiago Solari.[155] On 22 December 2018, Real Madrid beat Al Ain 4–1 in the FIFA Club World Cup and became the outright record winners of the Club World Cup with four titles.[156] However, they were then knocked out of the Copa del Rey at the semi-final stage by Barcelona, losing 1–4 on aggregate. On 5 March 2019, Real was defeated by Ajax 1–4 (3–5 on aggregate) at home, crashing out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage after eight consecutive semi-finals appearances. On 11 March 2019, Real Madrid dismissed Solari and reinstated Zidane as the head coach of the club.[157] Madrid finished the season with 68 points and a +17 goal difference, its lowest totals since 2001–02 and 1999–2000 respectively.[158]\\n\\nIn the summer of 2019, Madrid signed Eden Hazard, Luka Jović, Éder Militão, Ferland Mendy, Rodrygo, Reinier and other players for a total of more than €350 million.[159] On 12 January 2020, Madrid beat cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid in a penalty shootout in the Supercopa de España final to win their eleventh title.[160] After a three-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, La Liga was restarted in June and Madrid won ten games in a row to capture the team\\'s 34th league title, collecting 87 points in total.[161] From the competition\\'s resumption in June and until the end of the 2020–21 season, Real temporarily played home fixtures at the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, while the Santiago Bernabéu underwent extensive renovations.[162][163]\\n\\nFurther domestic success and La Decimocuarta\\n\\nReal Madrid players celebrating the double on 29 May 2022, the day after their Champions League victory\\n\\n\\nCourtois\\nMilitão\\nAlaba\\nCarvajal\\nMendy\\nCasemiro\\nModrić\\nKroos\\nValverde\\nVinícius Jr.\\nBenzema (C)\\n2022 UEFA Champions League final starting lineup\\nZidane left a second time on 27 May 2021 after going trophyless that season,[164] with Carlo Ancelotti returning to coach the team for the 2021–22 season.[165] On the domestic front, he delivered two trophies out of possible three, winning La Liga and the Supercopa de España.[166][167][168] As such, Ancelotti won all six available top trophies at Madrid.[169] In the Champions League, Madrid produced one of the most memorable runs of all time,[170] defeating pre-tournament favourites Paris Saint-Germain,[171][172] defending champions and favourites Chelsea,[173] Premier League champions and heavy favourites Manchester City,[174] all in dramatic fashion,[175] and setting up the final against Liverpool, who were once again widely considered as favourites,[176] in a rematch of their 2018 encounter. A lone Vinícius Júnior goal sealed the 14th European Cup for Los Blancos, their fifth in nine years, and Ancelotti\\'s second in charge.[177][178] Real also claimed their fourth ever European double (after 1956–57, 1957–58, and 2016–17). Despite Real\\'s status as the most decorated team in the history of the Champions League, they were not favoured to win that year\\'s edition, and their improbable run was widely considered a surprise.[179]\\n\\nEven more success and La Decimoquinta\\nAfter a highly successful 2021–22 season, Real Madrid signed German defender Antonio Rüdiger and French midfielder Aurélien Tchouaméni, while club legends Marcelo, Isco, Gareth Bale and Casemiro left the club. Real Madrid\\'s 2022–23 season began with lifting the UEFA Super Cup and later the FIFA Club World Cup. The season ended with Real Madrid winning the 2022–23 Copa del Rey, but losing the La Liga and Spanish Super Cup to Barcelona and the Champions League to Manchester City, being defeated 5–1 on aggregate.\\n\\nIn 2023, Real Madrid signed Jude Bellingham, who was given the number #5 jersey, previously used by Zinedine Zidane. Real also signed Arda Güler and Fran García. Meanwhile, Vinícius Júnior was given the number #7 jersey, previously used by Raúl and Cristiano Ronaldo; while Rodrygo was given the number #11 jersey, previously used by Gareth Bale. Karim Benzema left the club, while Toni Kroos would later announce that he would retire from football after this season.\\n\\nThe 2023–24 season would prove to be another highly successful season for Los Blancos. First, Real Madrid lifted the Spanish Super Cup against Barcelona 4–1, taking revenge of the previous year\\'s 3–0 defeat. Then, Real Madrid lifted the La Liga with relative ease, reaching 95 points, the second-best winning campaign by Real Madrid in La Liga history after the 2011–12 100 points season. In the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League, Real Madrid knocked out RB Leipzig in the Round of 16, then defending champions Manchester City in penalties.\\n\\nIn the semifinals, Real Madrid faced Bayern Munich again. The first match was a 2–2 draw, while the second match in the Bernabéu was marked by a double by Joselu in the last few minutes of the game, with Bayern Munich suffering a historic comeback after leading 1–0. Real Madrid faced Borussia Dortmund in the final, and won 2–0, with Dani Carvajal being the man of the match and scoring with a header after a Toni Kroos corner, and Vinícius Júnior once again scoring in a UCL final. Real Madrid won their 15th Champions League without losing a single match during the campaign.\\n\\nFollowing the conclusion of the 2023–24 season, Real Madrid announced that striker Kylian Mbappé would be joining the club on a free transfer from Paris Saint-Germain in July 2024, concluding one of the most highly anticipated transfer sagas in modern history.[180] On 18 December 2024, Real Madrid clinched their second trophy of the season, uplifting the inaugural 2024 FIFA Intercontinental Cup by beating Pachuca 3–0.[181]\\n\\nCrests and colours\\nCrests\\n1902\\n1902\\n \\n1908\\n1908\\n \\n1920\\n1920\\n \\n1931\\n1931\\n \\n2001\\n2001\\nThe first crest had a simple design consisting of a decorative interlacing of the three initials of the club, \"MCF\" for Madrid Club de Fútbol, in dark blue on a white shirt. The first change in the crest occurred in 1908 when the letters adopted a more streamlined form and appeared inside a circle.[182] The next change in the configuration of the crest did not occur until the presidency of Pedro Parages in 1920. At that time, King Alfonso XIII granted the club his royal patronage which came in the form of the title \"Real Madrid,\" meaning \"Royal.\"[183] Thus, Alfonso\\'s crown was added to the crest and the club styled itself Real Madrid Club de Fútbol.[182]\\n\\nWith the dissolution of the monarchy in 1931, all royal symbols (the crown on the crest and the title of Real) were eliminated. The crown was replaced by the dark mulberry band of the Region of Castile.[47] In 1941, two years after Nationalist victory in the Civil War, the Francoist regime restored the crest\\'s \"Real Corona\", or \"Royal Crown\", while the mulberry stripe of Castile was retained as well.[184][55] In addition, the whole crest was made full color, with gold being the most prominent, and the club went back to its honorific name Real Madrid Club de Fútbol.[182] The most recent modification to the crest occurred in 2001 when the club wanted to better situate itself for the 21st century and further standardize its crest. One of the modifications made was changing the mulberry stripe to a more bluish shade.[182]\\n\\nColours\\n\\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Real Madrid CF kits (1902–2000).\\n\\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Real Madrid CF kits (2000–present).\\n\\nReal Madrid in 1964. Nicknamed Los Blancos (The Whites), the club has worn an all-white home kit except for one season in 1925.\\nReal Madrid has maintained the white shirt for its home kit throughout the history of the club. There was, however, one season in 1926 that the shirt and shorts were not both white. It was an initiative undertaken by Juan Padrós in honour of an English team Corinthian, which he had met on one of his trips, one of the most famous teams at the time known for its elegance and sportsmanship.[42] It was decided that Real Madrid would wear black shorts in an attempt to replicate the English team, which had also inspired Madrid\\'s original white kit, but the initiative lasted just one year. After being eliminated from the 1926 Copa del Rey by Barcelona with a 1–5 defeat in Madrid and a 2–0 defeat in Catalonia, President Parages decided to return to an all-white kit, claiming that the other kit brought bad luck.[note 3] By the early 1940s, the manager changed the kit again by adding buttons to the shirt and the club\\'s crest on the left breast, which has remained ever since. On 23 November 1947, in a game against Atlético Madrid at the Metropolitano Stadium, Real Madrid became the first Spanish team to wear numbered shirts.[55] English club Leeds United permanently switched their blue shirt for a white one in the 1960s, to emulate the dominant Real Madrid of the era.[185]\\n\\nReal\\'s traditional away colours are all blue or all purple. Since the advent of the replica kit market, the club has also released various other one colour designs, including red, green, orange and black. The club\\'s kit is manufactured by Adidas, whose contract extends from 1998.[186][187] Real Madrid\\'s first shirt sponsor, Zanussi, agreed for the 1982–83, 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons. Following that, the club was sponsored by Parmalat and Otaysa before a long-term deal was signed with Teka in 1992.[188][189] In 2001, Real Madrid ended their contract with Teka and for one season and used the Realmadrid.com logo to promote the club\\'s website. Then, in 2002, a deal was signed with Siemens and in 2006, the BenQ Siemens logo appeared on the club\\'s shirt.[190] Real Madrid\\'s shirt sponsor from 2007 until 2013 was bwin.com following the economic problems of BenQ Siemens.[191][192] Fly Emirates became their shirt sponsor in 2013, and in 2017 the club renewed the sponsorship with the airliner, signing a deal until 2022 worth €70 million per year.[193] In 2022, the agreement was again extended, until 2026.[194] In 2015, Madrid signed a new ten-year contract with Adidas, believed to be worth a total of £850 million (€1 billion), with the club earning £59 million (€64 million) per season. The contract includes a clause sanctioning penalty or agreement termination anytime, if Real Madrid fails to qualify for the European competitions or is relegated from La Liga.[195]\\n\\nKit suppliers and shirt sponsors\\n\\nReal Madrid\\'s jersey (worn by Luka Modrić in 2015) is manufactured by Adidas, with Emirates the shirt sponsor.\\nPeriod\\tKit manufacturer\\tShirt sponsor\\n1981–1982\\tAdidas\\t—\\n1982–1985\\tZanussi\\n1985–1989\\tHummel\\tParmalat\\n1989–1991\\tReny Picot\\n1991–1992\\tOtaysa\\n1992–1994\\tTeka\\n1994–1998\\tKelme\\n1998–2001\\tAdidas\\n2001–2002\\tRealmadrid.com[note 4]\\n2002–2005\\tSiemens mobile\\n2005–2006\\tSiemens\\n2006–2007\\tBenQ-Siemens\\n2007–2013\\tbwin\\n2013–\\tEmirates\\nKit deal\\nKit supplier\\tPeriod\\tContract\\nannouncement\\tContract\\nduration\\tValue\\tNotes\\nAdidas\\n1998–present\\nUndisclosed\\n2015–2020 (6 years)\\tTotal €1 billion[196]\\t\\n8 May 2019\\n2020–2028 (8 years)[197]\\tTotal €1.1 billion[198]\\t\\nNote: early termination clauses can be activated at any time depending on the team\\'s performance.\\n\\nGrounds\\nFurther information: Estadio Chamartín, Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, and Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium\\nSantiago Bernabéu\\n\\nCapacity\\t85,000[199]\\nField size\\t107 m × 72 m (351 ft × 236 ft)[200]\\nConstruction\\nBroke ground\\t27 October 1944\\nOpened\\t14 December 1947\\nArchitect\\tManuel Muñoz Monasterio, Luis Alemany Soler, Antonio Lamela\\nAfter moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the Campo de O\\'Donnell in 1912, which remained its home stadium for 11 years.[44] After this period, the club moved for one year to the Campo de Ciudad Lineal, a small ground with a capacity of 8,000 spectators. After that, Real Madrid started playing its home matches at the Estadio Chamartín, which was inaugurated on 17 May 1923 with a match against Newcastle United.[201] In this stadium, which hosted 22,500 spectators, Real Madrid celebrated its first Spanish league title.[46] Following his election in 1943, president Santiago Bernabéu decided that the Chamartín was not big enough for the ambitions of the club, and thus a new stadium was built and inaugurated on 14 December 1947.[55][202] Initially knows as Nuevo Chamartín, the stadium was renamed in honour of Bernabéu in 1955 and continues to bear his name to this day.[56] The first match at the Bernabéu was played between Madrid and the Portuguese club Belenenses, with Los Blancos winning 3–1 and Sabino Barinaga scoring the first goal.[55]\\n\\nThe capacity has changed frequently, peaking at 120,000 after a 1953 expansion.[203] Since then, there have been a number of reductions due to modernizations (the last standing areas were removed in 1998–99 in response to UEFA regulations which had forbidden standing at matches in European competitions), countered to some extent by expansions.[203] The current capacity is 81,044 spectators. Real Madrid has the fourth-highest average attendance in Europe, behind Borussia Dortmund, Barcelona and Manchester United.[204][205][206][207]\\n\\nThe Bernabéu has hosted the 1964 UEFA European Championship final, the 1982 FIFA World Cup final, and the 1957, 1969, 1980 and 2010 European Cup/Champions League finals.[208] The stadium has its own namesake Madrid Metro station along the 10 line.[209] On 14 November 2007, the Bernabéu was upgraded to Elite Football Stadium status by UEFA.[210]\\n\\nOn 9 May 2006, the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, named after club legend Alfredo Di Stéfano, was inaugurated in the Real Madrid City, where Real Madrid usually trains. The inaugural match was played between Real Madrid and Reims, a rematch of the 1956 European Cup final. Real Madrid 6–1, with goals from Sergio Ramos, Antonio Cassano (2), Roberto Soldado (2) and José Manuel Jurado. The venue is now part of the Ciudad Real Madrid, the club\\'s training facility located outside Madrid, in Valdebebas. The stadium\\'s capacity is 5,000 people, and it is Real Madrid Castilla\\'s home ground.[211] For the latter part of the 2019–20 season and throughout the 2020–21 season, the stadium hosted the first team\\'s home games due to a combination of the COVID-19 pandemic-triggered restrictions and an extensive renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu.[212][163]\\n\\nThe latest renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu is set to increase the capacity by approximately 4,000 with the addition of an extra tier, bringing it to nearly 85,000.[213][214] Furthermore, the height will also be increased by ten metres and a retractable roof, a retractable pitch and a 360-degree screen will be installed.[215][216] The works have started in 2019, and the renovated stadium was initially planned to be unveiled in 2022; however, the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine caused significant disruption to supply chains, prompting the club to postpone the stadium\\'s inauguration to 2023.[217][218]\\n\\nRecords and statistics\\nMain article: List of Real Madrid CF records and statistics\\nSee also: Real Madrid CF in international football\\n\\nRaúl is Real Madrid\\'s all-time leader in appearances.\\nRaúl holds the record for most appearances with Real Madrid, with 741  appearances from 1994 to 2010. Iker Casillas comes second with 725 appearances, followed by Manuel Sanchis Jr., having played 710 times.[219] The record for a goalkeeper is held by Iker Casillas, with 725 appearances. With 63 goals, Cristiano Ronaldo has scored the most international goals while playing for the club. Meanwhile, Sergio Ramos has accumulated the most caps while playing for the club, with 176.\\n\\n\\nCristiano Ronaldo is Real Madrid\\'s record goalscorer and the first player ever to score against every team in a single La Liga season.\\nCristiano Ronaldo (2009–2018) is Real Madrid\\'s all-time top goalscorer, with 450 goals in 438 matches.[220][221] Six other players have also scored over 200 goals for Real: Alfredo Di Stéfano (1953–1964), Santillana (1971–1988), Ferenc Puskás (1958–1966), Hugo Sánchez (1985–1992), Karim Benzema (2009–2023) and the previous goalscoring record-holder Raúl (1994–2010). Cristiano Ronaldo also holds the record for the most league goals scored in one season (48 in 2014–15), alongside being Real\\'s top goalscorer of all time in La Liga history with 311 goals. Di Stéfano\\'s 49 goals in 58 matches was for decades the all-time highest tally in the European Cup, until it was surpassed by Raúl in 2005, and is now held by Cristiano Ronaldo with 105 goals for Madrid and 140 overall. The fastest goal in the history of the club (13 seconds) was scored by the Chilean Iván Zamorano on 3 September 1994 during a league match against Sevilla.[222]\\n\\nOfficially, the highest home attendance figure for a Real Madrid match is 129,690, which was for a European Cup match in 1956 against Milan. The current official capacity of the Santiago Bernabéu is 80,000.[223] Real has also set records in Spanish football, most notably the most domestic titles (36 as of 2023–24) and the most seasons won in a row (five, during 1960–65 and 1985–90).[1] With 121 matches (from 17 February 1957 to 7 March 1965), the club holds the record for longest unbeaten run at home in La Liga.[224]\\n\\n\\nGareth Bale is the club\\'s joint record signing, costing €100 million in 2013.\\nThe club also holds the record for winning the European Cup/UEFA Champions League fifteen times[225] and for the most semi-finals appearances (33). As of June 2024, Cristiano Ronaldo is the all-time top scorer in the UEFA Champions League, with 140 (141 including qualifiers) goals in total, 105 while playing for Real Madrid. The team has the record number of consecutive participations in the European Cup (before it became the Champions League) with 15, from 1955–56 to 1969–70.[226] Among the club\\'s on-field records is a 22-game winning streak in all competitions during the 2014–15 season, a Spanish record. In September 2017, the club equalled the record of the Brazilian club Santos, starring Pelé, by scoring in their 73rd consecutive game, before Bayern Munich breaks the record in 2021.[227]\\n\\nIn June 2009, the club broke its own record for the highest transfer fee ever paid in the history of football after purchasing Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo for €94 million (£80 million).[228][229] The fee of €77.5 million (100 billion lire) for Zinedine Zidane\\'s transfer from Juventus to Real Madrid in 2001 was the previous highest transfer fee ever paid. This record (in pounds sterling) had been broken previously in June 2009, for a few days, when Real Madrid agreed to buy Kaká from Milan for €67 million (£65 million). The transfer of Tottenham Hotspur\\'s Gareth Bale in 2013 was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer fee approximated at around €100 million.[109] In January 2016, documents pertaining to Bale\\'s transfer were leaked which confirmed a world record transfer fee of €100,759,418.[230] Real Madrid equalled their record signing in 2019, when the club signed Eden Hazard from Chelsea for a reported €115 million.[231] The club\\'s record sale occurred on 10 July 2018, when Juventus signed Cristiano Ronaldo for €117 million.[232]\\n\\nSupport\\n\\nThe number of season tickets at the Bernabéu is capped at 65,000, with the remaining seats made available to the general public.\\nDuring most home matches, the majority of the seats in the stadium are occupied by season-ticket holders, of which the figure is capped at 65,000.[233] To become a season ticket holder one must first be a socio, or club member. In addition to members, the club has more than 1,800 peñas (official, club-affiliated supporters\\' groups) in Spain and around the world. Real Madrid has the second highest average all-time attendance in Spanish football and regularly attracts over 74,000 fans to the Bernabéu. One of the best supported teams globally, Real Madrid was the first sports team (and first brand) to reach 100 million fans on Facebook in April 2017.[234][235]\\n\\nReal Madrid\\'s hardcore supporters are the so-called Ultras Sur supporters, or simply Ultras. They are known for their extreme right-wing politics, akin to Barcelona\\'s hardcore supporters group Boixos Nois. The Ultras Surs have developed an alliance with other right wing groups, most notably Lazio Irriducibili fans, and have also developed an alliance with left-wing groups. On several occasions, they have racially abused opposing players, and have been investigated by UEFA for doing so.[236][237] Florentino Pérez took it upon himself to ban the Ultras from the Bernabéu and assign their seats to the general public. This decision was controversial with some of the Bernabéu faithful, however, as the lively atmosphere of games would suffer as a result.[238][239] The Ultras have since held protests outside the Bernabéu and have demanded to be reinstated and allowed to enter the grounds.[240]\\n\\nQuestioned over Pope Francis\\' adherence to 2014 FIFA Club World Cup Final opponents San Lorenzo, Madrid captain Sergio Ramos stated: \"In the semi-finals we noticed the love from supporters in Marrakesh and it seemed like we were playing at home. That sums up the greatness of this team. Madrid is God\\'s team and the team of the world\".[241] Among the club\\'s famous supporters is golfer Sergio García, who was invited to take the honorary kickoff for El Clásico at the Bernabeu wearing his green jacket from winning the 2017 Masters.[242]\\n\\nRivalries\\nEl Clásico\\nMain article: El Clásico\\n\\nScene from a 2011 El Clásico at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium\\nThere is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Real Madrid and Barcelona is known as \"The Classic\" (El Clásico). From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Castile and Catalonia, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between the Castilians and Catalans, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.[243] Over the years, the record for Real Madrid and Barcelona is 105 victories for Madrid, 101 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws as of December 2024.[244]\\n\\n\\nReal Madrid fans displaying the white of their club before El Clásico. Real Madrid fans also often wave Spanish flags at El Clásico games.[245]\\nAs early as the 1930s, Barcelona \"had developed a reputation as a symbol of Catalan identity, opposed to the centralising tendencies of Madrid\".[246][247] During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera and especially Francisco Franco, all regional languages and identities in Spain were frowned upon and restrained. As such, most citizens of Barcelona were in strong opposition to Franco\\'s regime. In that period, Barcelona gained their motto Més que un club (English: More than a club) because of its alleged connection to Catalan nationalist as well as to progressive beliefs.[248]\\n\\nThere is an ongoing controversy as to what extent Franco\\'s rule (1939–75) influenced the activities and on-pitch results of both Barcelona and Real Madrid. Fans of both clubs tend to exaggerate the myths favouring their narratives. Most historians agree that Franco did not have a preferred football team, but his Spanish nationalist beliefs led him to associate himself with the establishment teams, such as Atlético Aviación and Madrid FC (that recovered its \"royal\" name after the fall of the Republic and again became Real Madrid). On the other hand, he also wanted the renamed Barcelona succeed as \"Spanish team\", rather than a Catalan one. During the early years of Franco\\'s rule, Real Madrid were not particularly successful, winning two Copa del Generalísimo titles and a Copa Eva Duarte; Barcelona claimed three league titles, one Copa del Generalísimo and one Copa Eva Duarte. During that period, Atlético Aviación were believed to be the preferred team over Real Madrid. The most contested stories of the period include Real Madrid\\'s 11–1 home win against Barcelona in the Copa del Generalísimo, where the Catalan team alleged intimidation, and the controversial transfer of Alfredo Di Stéfano to Real Madrid, despite his agreement with Barcelona. The latter transfer was part of Real Madrid chairman Santiago Bernabéu\\'s \"revolution\" that ushered in the era of unprecedented dominance. Bernabéu, himself a veteran of the Civil War who fought for Franco\\'s forces, saw Real Madrid on top, not only of Spanish, but also European football, helping create the European Cup, the first true competition for Europe\\'s best club sides. His vision was fulfilled when Real Madrid not only started winning consecutive league titles, but also swept the first five editions of the European Cup in the 1950s.[249] These events had a profound impact on Spanish football and influenced Franco\\'s attitude. According to historians, during this time he realized the importance of Real Madrid for his regime\\'s international image, and the club became his preferred team until his death. Fernando Maria Castiella, who served as minister of foreign affairs under Franco from 1957 until 1969, noted that \"[Real Madrid] is the best embassy we have ever had\". Franco died in 1975, and the Spanish transition to democracy soon followed. Under his rule, Real Madrid had won 14 league titles, six Copa del Generalísimo titles, one Copa Eva Duarte, six European Cups, two Latin Cups and one Intercontinental Cup. In the same period, Barcelona had won eight league titles, nine Copa del Generalísimo titles, three Copa Eva Duarte titles, three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups and two Latin Cups.[250][184]\\n\\nThe rivalry was intensified during the 1950s when the clubs disputed the signing of Alfredo Di Stéfano. Di Stéfano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for Los Millonarios in Bogotá, Colombia, during a players\\' strike in his native Argentina. Soon after Millonarios\\' return to Colombia, Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team to have held Di Stéfano\\'s rights, for his transfer in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian lira (according to other sources 200,000 dollars). This started a battle between the two Spanish rivals for his rights. FIFA appointed Armando Muñoz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football Federation as mediator. Calero decided to let Di Stéfano play the 1953–54 and 1955–56 seasons in Madrid, and the 1954–55 and 1956–57 seasons in Barcelona. The agreement was approved by the Football Association and their respective clubs. Although the Catalans agreed, the decision created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president was forced to resign in September 1953. Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di Stéfano moved to Los Blancos, signing a four-year contract. Real paid 5.5 million Spanish pesetas for the transfer, plus a 1.3 million bonus for the purchase, an annual fee to be paid to the Millonarios, and a 16,000 salary for Di Stéfano with a bonus double that of his teammates, for a total of 40% of the annual revenue of the Madrid club.[251]\\n\\nDi Stéfano became integral in the subsequent success achieved by Real Madrid, scoring twice in his first game against Barcelona. With him, Madrid won the first five editions of the European Cup.[252] The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when Real Madrid and Barcelona met twice in the European Cup, with Madrid triumphing en route to their fifth consecutive title in 1959–60 and Barcelona prevailing en route to losing the final in 1960–61. Ahead of the 1973–74 season, Johan Cruyff arrived to Barcelona for a world record £920,000 from Ajax.[253] Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son \"Jordi\", after the local Catalan Saint George.[254] In 2002, the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the \"Match of The Century\" by Spanish media, and Madrid\\'s win was watched by more than 500 million people around the world.[255] A fixture known for its intensity and indiscipline, it has also featured memorable goal celebrations from both teams, often involving mocking the opposition.[256] In October 1999, Real Madrid forward Raúl silenced 100,000 Barcelona fans at the Camp Nou when he scored before he celebrated by putting a finger to his lips as if telling the crowd to be quiet.[256][257] In 2009, Barcelona captain Carles Puyol kissed his Catalan armband in front of Madrid fans at the Bernabéu.[256] Cristiano Ronaldo twice gestured to the hostile crowd to \"calm down\" after scoring against Barcelona at the Camp Nou in 2012 and 2016.[256] In April 2017, Messi celebrated his 93rd-minute winner for Barcelona against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu by taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans – with his name and number facing them.[256] Later that year, in August, Ronaldo was subbed on in the first leg of the Supercopa de España, proceeded to score in the 80th minute and took his shirt off before holding it up to Barça\\'s fans with his name and number facing them.[258]\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'Paris Saint-Germain F.C.': 'Paris Saint-Germain Football Club, commonly referred to as Paris Saint-Germain (French: [paʁi sɛ̃ʒɛʁmɛ̃]) or simply PSG, is a professional football club based in Paris, France. They compete in Ligue 1, the top division of French football.\\n\\nFounded in 1970, following the merger of Paris FC and Stade Saint-Germain, PSG have the most consecutive seasons playing in France\\'s top flight. They are the most popular football club in France and one of the most widely supported teams in the world. They are nicknamed the Les Rouge-et-Bleu (The Red-and-Blues), for the shirt colour that also includes white, and their crest features the Eiffel Tower and a fleur-de-lis. The team has a longstanding rivalry with Marseille, against whom they contest Le Classique. PSG have played their home matches in the 48,000-capacity Parc des Princes in Paris since 1973, located in the 16th arrondissement of Paris near the Boulogne-Billancourt commune.\\n\\nThey won their first major honour, the French Cup, in 1982 and their first Division 1 title in 1986. The 1990s was among the most successful periods in the club\\'s history. After suffering a decline in fortunes during the 2000s, the Red and Blues have enjoyed a revival since 2011 when they were taken over by Qatar Sports Investments. With considerable financial investment, allowing the club to buy superstar players such as Zlatan Ibrahimović, Edinson Cavani and Neymar, the team has achieved unparalleled dominance in domestic competitions, winning multiple league titles and national cups and became a regular feature in the UEFA Champions League.\\n\\nWith 51 major trophies won, PSG are the most decorated club in France. They have won 49 domestic trophies: a record 13 Ligue 1 titles, a record 15 Coupe de France, a record 9 Coupe de la Ligue, and record 13 Trophée des Champions. Internationally, they won the UEFA Cup Winners\\' Cup in 1996 – unique feat in French football – and were runners-up in 1997, making them one of two French clubs to have won a major European title. They also won the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2001 and were runners-up in the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League.\\n\\nSince 2011, PSG have been majority-owned by Qatari government-backed investment fund Qatar Sports Investments, which currently holds 87.5% of the shares. American investment firm Arctos Partners owns the remaining 12.5%. PSG are the richest club in France and one of the wealthiest in the world. PSG currently have the third-highest revenue in the footballing world with annual earnings of €806m according to Deloitte, and are the world\\'s seventh-most valuable football club, worth $4.4bn according to Forbes.\\n\\nHistory\\nMain article: History of Paris Saint-Germain FC\\nCreation and split (1970–1973)\\n\\nGuy Crescent (pictured), Pierre-Étienne Guyot and Henri Patrelle founded PSG in 1970.\\nIn the summer of 1970, an ambitious group of businessmen decided to create a major team in the French capital.[1][2] Guy Crescent and Pierre-Étienne Guyot chose to merge their virtual side, Paris FC, created in 1969, with Stade Saint-Germain of Henri Patrelle after the team from Saint-Germain-en-Laye, 15 km west of Paris and founded in 1904, won promotion to Division 2.[1][2][3] However, the three men were stuck with the financial feasibility of the project until they met Real Madrid president Santiago Bernabéu.[4][5] He told them that starting a crowdfunding campaign was the best solution to establish a new team. 20,000 people backed the project and Paris Saint-Germain were formed on 17 June 1970.[4] Guyot was elected the club\\'s first president a few days later.[1][6][7] For the first time in French football history, the fans had financially contributed in the making of a club.[8] The merger was made official following the creation of the club\\'s association on 12 August 1970.[6] PSG retains this day as their foundation date.[1]\\n\\nParis FC contributed with the financial backing, while Stade Saint-Germain provided the sporting infrastructure, from the Division 2 status to the Camp des Loges training center, as well as the manager Pierre Phelipon and most of the players, including Bernard Guignedoux, Michel Prost and Camille Choquier.[9] PSG further strengthened their squad with the signing of Jean Djorkaeff, captain of the French national team.[10] PSG\\'s first official game was a 1–1 league draw away to Poitiers on 23 August 1970. Guignedoux scored the club\\'s first ever goal from a free-kick.[11] The club went on to clinch promotion to Division 1 and claim the Division 2 title in its inaugural season.[2][12]\\n\\nPSG\\'s first top-flight season ended with a safe 16th place, meaning they would stay in Division 1 next year, but behind the scenes the club was in a delicate financial situation.[9][13] Back in September 1971, the Paris City Council offered 850k francs to pay the club\\'s debt and save its place in the elite, demanding PSG in return to adopt the more Parisian name \"Paris Football Club.\"[9][14] Crescent, who had replaced Guyot as club president before the start of the season, was in favor of the name change, but Patrelle was against it.[3][15] The disagreement led to Crescent\\'s resignation in December 1971, handing the presidency to Patrelle.[14] The latter tried to persuade the council to reconsider their position, but they remained inflexible and the club split on 1 June 1972, a few days after the last match of the campaign.[9][14][16] Backed by the council, Crescent re-formed Paris FC and remained in Division 1, while the PSG of Patrelle were administratively relegated to Division 3, thus losing professional status.[3][9][10]\\n\\nTop-flight return and Parc des Princes move (1973–1978)\\n\\nJust Fontaine helped Paris Saint-Germain return to Division 1 in 1974.\\nParis Saint-Germain really took flight with the arrival of fashion designer Daniel Hechter as chairman of the management committee in June 1973.[1][17] Besides offering his financial support to the club, he also designed the team\\'s classic home outfit.[13][18] Hechter then shocked the national game ahead of 1973–74 by appointing French legend Just Fontaine as sporting director.[9][10]\\n\\nRobert Vicot\\'s men finished second in Group B, four points behind Red Star, qualifying for the promotion play–offs against Valenciennes. PSG lost 1–2 away to Valenciennes, but PSG recorded an incredible 4–2 comeback at the Parc des Princes, thus achieving promotion to Division 1 and regaining its professional status abandoned two years earlier.[9][19] Overwhelmed by emotion, Fontaine collapsed on the lawn and was then carried by the players in celebration.[19][20] Since then, PSG have always played in the first tier of French football.[19]\\n\\nPSG played their first game at the Parc des Princes during this campaign. It was against fellow Parisian side Red Star on 10 November 1973. PSG won 3–1 and Othniel Dossevi scored the club\\'s first goal at the stadium.[21] The Parisians also began their tradition of brilliant Coupe de France runs, reaching the quarterfinals after beating Metz at the Parc in front of 25,000 spectators (2–1; 4–1 on aggregate).[22]\\n\\nIn an ironic turn of events, Paris FC were relegated to Division 2 at the same time as Paris Saint-Germain moved up to the top flight in 1974, leaving their home stadium, the Parc des Princes, in the hands of their estranged Parisian brothers. Since then, the Parc has been the home of PSG.[9][16] With promotion to Division 1 also came a change of command. Daniel Hechter, then chairman of the management committee, took over as club president in June 1974 following the resignation of Patrelle.[17][23] He named Francis Borelli as vice-president.[18][22]\\n\\nUnder Hechter\\'s tenure, the Parisians failed to win any silverware in the 1970s but began their tradition of brilliant Coupe de France runs, established themselves in Division 1, and attracted several prestigious players, including Jean-Pierre Dogliani, Mustapha Dahleb and Carlos Bianchi.[9][10] After Hechter was banned for life from football by the French Football Federation in January 1978, for running a ticketing scheme at the Parc des Princes, Francis Borelli, who had been vice-president until then, became the new boss of the Île-de-France club.[9][18][22]\\n\\nFirst major honours and decline (1978–1991)\\nFollowing the arrival of manager Georges Peyroche in November 1979,[24] the club established itself as a top-half team and then welcomed its first major honour when the Parisians reached their first French Cup final in 1982.[13][25][26][27] Up against the great Saint-Étienne of Michel Platini at the Parc des Princes, Nambatingue Toko opened the scoring for PSG following a good cross from Ivica Šurjak. Saint-Étienne reacted and Platini equalized to send the game to extra-time. Platini then doubled his personal account, giving the Greens the lead.[20][21][28] The Parc des Princes faithful no longer believed in their team when Dominique Rocheteau, after yet another assist from Šurjak, scored an unexpected equalizer in the last seconds of the match.[20][21] PSG fans invaded the field in joy, while club president Francis Borelli kneeled and kissed the lawn of the Parc.[20][28] Following an interruption of 30 minutes, the penalty shootout sealed PSG\\'s coronation.[21][28] Dominique Baratelli stopped Saint-Étienne\\'s last attempt and Jean-Marc Pilorget scored the winning penalty for the capital side.[20][28] This success opened the doors to Europe, where PSG made an impressive continental debut in reaching the quarterfinals of the 1982–83 European Cup Winners\\' Cup.[12][29]\\n\\n\\nDominique Rocheteau scored one of the club\\'s most iconic goals ever.\\nOn the domestic scene, results were just as satisfying. PSG captured their first podium finish, coming in third place, and repeated the feat in the 1983 Coupe de France Final, this time against Nantes.[10][30] Recently crowned French champions, the Canaries were headed for the league-cup double, leading at the break after overturning Pascal Zaremba\\'s early strike. But PSG managed their own comeback in the second half as Sušić equalized and then assisted Toko for the winning goal (3–2).[25][29][30] The campaign ended on a sad note, though, as Georges Peyroche left the club.[31]\\n\\nThree years later, under the guidance of manager Gérard Houllier, PSG claimed their maiden league crown in 1985–86.[10][32] They dominated the championship from start to finish thanks in big part to the likes of Joël Bats, Dominique Bathenay, Luis Fernandez, Dominique Rocheteau and Safet Sušić, all of whom made up the backbone of the team.[9][25] The victory away to Toulouse on Matchday 3 meant PSG sat at the top of the table for the first time ever, a spot they never relinquished, going a memorable 26 matches without defeat towards the title.[9][25][32]\\n\\nThe follow-up to the league title was not as glorious though.[25] Defending champions PSG finished the league in seventh place, suffered an early exit from the French Cup and were knocked out by Czech minnows Vítkovice in the first round of a disappointing European Cup debut.[25][33][34] The following year, PSG avoided relegation on the final match of the 1987–88 season thanks to a dramatic 0–1 win away to Le Havre.[35] Highly indebted, the club briefly bounced back, fighting for the 1988–89 league crown with Marseille, before going into decline.[25][36][37]\\n\\nCanal+ takeover and golden era (1991–1998)\\nNapoli, stadio San Paolo, 21 ottobre 1992. L\\'attaccante liberiano George Weah esulta dopo uno dei suoi due gol che decisero la sfida tra e (0–2) valevole per l\\'andata dei sedicesimi di finale della Coppa UEFA 1992–1993.\\nGeorge Weah during his playing days at Paris Saint-Germain\\nThe takeover by television giants Canal+ in 1991 revitalised Paris Saint-Germain as they became one of the richest clubs in France.[1][18] Canal+ wiped out PSG\\'s huge debt and appointed Michel Denisot, journalist on the channel, as club president in place of Francis Borelli.[18][38] Now enjoying serious investment, the Red and Blues were able to set their sights steadily higher: they had to qualify for European competitions in their first season and become French champions within three years.[9][38] In consequence, Canal+ increased the club\\'s budget from 90 to 120 million francs in order to build a strong squad for the 1991–92 season.[9][38] The revolution began with the appointment of renowned coach Artur Jorge, famous for leading Porto to the 1986–87 European Cup trophy. The club then embarked on a spending spree, signing Brazilian stars Ricardo and Valdo as well as proven French players Paul Le Guen, Laurent Fournier, Patrick Colleter and prolific Liberian striker George Weah.[38]\\n\\nThe 1992–93 season also marked the beginning of Le Classique, the rivalry between Paris Saint-Germain and Marseille, as both teams battled each other on the field for the 1992–93 French Division 1 crown.[38] PSG finished runners-up after losing both games against Marseille.[39][40] In the second match between the two clubs, only three days after winning the 1992–93 UEFA Champions League, league leaders Marseille welcomed closest challengers PSG in a match that would determine the title.[40] After Marseille won their fifth consecutive championship, Bernard Tapie and Marseille were found guilty of match-fixing, in what became known as the French football bribery scandal.[41][42] The French Football Federation stripped Marseille of their title and offered it to second-placed PSG, who refused it because club owners Canal+ thought that claiming the trophy would anger their subscribers back in Marseille.[40][43] As a result, the 1992–93 title remained unattributed, with Canal+ even refusing to let the capital club participate in the following year\\'s UEFA Champions League after UEFA excluded Marseille from the competition. Instead, Monaco, who finished third in Ligue 1, took the Champions League spot.[43]\\n\\nConsidered the club\\'s golden era, the Parisians won nine trophies and reached five consecutive European semi-finals during the 1990s, including their first UEFA Champions League last-four appearance and two at the same stage of the UEFA Cup.[9][12][38] PSG\\'s crowning glory came in the 1996 UEFA Cup Winners\\' Cup Final with legend Luis Fernandez now as coach.[44] Bruno Ngotty scored the only goal of the match to defeat Rapid Wien and make Paris the second French club to ever clinch a major European tournament and the youngest club in history to win a European title at 26 years of existence.[45][46] The following season, PSG finished runners-up in the 1996 UEFA Super Cup and 1997 UEFA Cup Winners\\' Cup Final.[47][48] On the domestic scene, results were just as satisfying, with Paris celebrating a second league title, three French Cups, two French League Cups and just as many French Super Cup wins.[9][12][38]\\n\\nCrisis mode and relegation battles (1998–2011)\\n\\nClub legend Pauleta, who was PSG\\'s all-time top goalscorer, before the QSI takeover\\nPSG then went into decline following years of mismanagement.[12] In the summer 2000, PSG spent heavily on new players signing Nicolas Anelka, Peter Luccin and Stéphane Dalmat as part of the \"PSG Banlieue\" project of its shareholder Canal+, with the goal of winning Ligue 1 and performing a solid UEFA Champions League campaign but it was a failure.[12] In 2003, the club faced a massive financial loss with a deficit of €65 million, leading Canal+ to fire Luis Fernandez as coach and Laurent Perpère as president and replacing them with Vahid Halilhodžić, who became the new coach and Francis Graille the new president.[12] The club\\'s form dwindled as they slipped further down the table and eventually, a split from owners Canal+ became inevitable.[9][12]\\n\\nAt the start of the 21st century, PSG struggled to rescale the heights despite the magic of Ronaldinho and the goals of Pauleta.[1] Five more trophies arrived in the form of three French Cups (including one against Le Classique arch-rivals Marseille in 2006), one French League Cup and one UEFA Intertoto Cup, but the club became better known for lurching from one high-profile crisis to another.[12][49][50]\\n\\nThe French premium television channel sold the club to Colony Capital in 2006. The situation, however, only got worse and PSG spent the 2006–07 and 2007–08 campaigns staving off relegations.[9][12] The latter was the most dramatic. Marred by poor results and fan violence, Paris avoided the drop on the final match after a 2–1 win at Sochaux. The hero was Ivorian striker Amara Diané who scored both goals that night. Despite not enjoying the star status of other current or past PSG greats, Diané is still considered a legend by most Parisian fans.[8]\\n\\nQSI ownership and domestic dominance (2011–present)\\nAfter two years of solid progress and stability under the stewardship of manager Antoine Kombouaré and president Robin Leproux, the fortunes of Paris Saint-Germain changed dramatically when Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) purchased the club in 2011.[12] The takeover made PSG not only the richest club in France but one of the wealthiest in the world.[51] Club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi pledged to form a team capable of winning the UEFA Champions League and making the club France\\'s biggest name.[12][52]\\n\\n\\nZlatan Ibrahimović greeting PSG fans in the Eiffel Tower on the day he signed for the club in July 2012\\nClub legend Leonardo was brought back in as sporting director and oversaw a spending spree in summer 2011 that has so far been unprecedented in Ligue 1 history, including the signings of Blaise Matuidi, Salvatore Sirigu, Maxwell, Kevin Gameiro and Javier Pastore.[12] As a result, the Parisians have dominated French football, despite finishing behind Montpellier in 2011–12, the elusive league crown was finally brought back to Paris in 2012–13 driven by star player Zlatan Ibrahimović, team captain Thiago Silva and manager Carlo Ancelotti.[12][53] During the season, ahead of the winter transfer deadline it was announced that David Beckham signed a five-month deal with the club.[54][55] Ibrahimović\\'s 30-goal haul helped the capital side to its first Ligue 1 title in 19 years, and third overall. They also became a regular in the knockout stages of the Champions League,[56] being eliminated from the UEFA Champions League on away goals by Barcelona in the quarter-finals after drawing both games.[53] Big money signings continued with the arrivals of Edinson Cavani in 2013 for a league record of €64 million,[57] making it the sixth largest transfer in history and David Luiz in 2014 for a £50 million transfer fee, a world-record transfer for a defender.[58][59] Despite the departure of Ancelotti, PSG kept its winning ways under Laurent Blanc. The club secured a maiden domestic treble (Ligue 1, Coupe de la Ligue and Trophée des Champions) in the 2013–14 season, before claiming an unprecedented national quadruple (Ligue 1, Coupe de France, Coupe de la Ligue and Trophée des Champions) twice in a row in 2014–15 and 2015–16, winning the latter with a record-breaking 96 points, becoming the only first French men\\'s team to achieve that feat.[60][61]\\n\\nFresh from three consecutive UEFA Europa League titles with Sevilla, Unai Emery was hired by PSG for his European pedigree.[52] But with star player Ibrahimović gone, the club endured a disappointing 2016–17 season.[62][63] Paris were pipped to the Ligue 1 title by Monaco, missing out on top spot for the first time in five years. Meanwhile, in the Champions League, the club suffered several disappointing nights,[56] including \"La Remontada\" (\"The Comeback\") against Barcelona, losing 6–1 in the second leg of the round of sixteen, despite winning the first leg in France by a score of 4–0.[64]\\n\\nNeymar Jr official presentation for Paris Saint-Germain, 4 August 2017.\\nNeymar during his presentation in 2017, after becoming the most expensive player ever\\nIn response, PSG signed Neymar for a world-record fee of €222 million and French prodigy Kylian Mbappé on an initial loan, which was made permanent in 2018 in a transfer worth €180 million plus add-ons, making him both the second-most expensive player and most expensive teenager.[65] The capital club reclaimed the Ligue 1 title and also won the Trophée des Champions, the Coupe de la Ligue and the Coupe de France, clinching the domestic quadruple for the third time in four seasons.[66] Despite their massive expenditure, in the Champions League, PSG lost to Real Madrid in the round of 16, leading Unai Emery to leave the club at the end of the season.[67]\\n\\nIn May 2018, Thomas Tuchel signed a two-year contract with PSG[68] and in the 2019–20 season, PSG won the Ligue 1 for the 9th time in their history, despite the season ending prematurely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and also reclaimed the Coupe de France defeating Saint-Étienne in the final and won the last-ever Coupe de la Ligue defeating Lyon in a penalty shootout.[69] In the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, PSG reached the semi-finals for the second time since 1995, after a last minute 2–1 win over Atalanta,[70] before losing to Bayern Munich 1–0 in the final in Lisbon, with former PSG player Kingsley Coman scoring the only goal.[71]\\n\\n\\nRecord Ballon d\\'Or winner Lionel Messi, who signed for the club in August 2021\\nDuring the 2021 summer transfer season, PSG completed one of the most historic transfer windows in football history, exercising the option to buy Danilo Pereira and signing Achraf Hakimi from Inter Milan for a reported fee of €60 million. In addition, the club registered the free transfers of Georginio Wijnaldum, Sergio Ramos, and Gianluigi Donnarumma.[72][73][74] PSG concluded their transfer window with the signing of one of the greatest players of all time and record Ballon d\\'Or winner Lionel Messi, who unexpectedly left Barcelona following the expiration of his contract, and promising defender Nuno Mendes on an initial loan, which was made permanent in 2022.[75][76] Later in the season, PSG went on to reclaim the Ligue 1 title for the record 10th time.[77]\\n\\nUnsatisfied with the club direction and lack of European success club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi promised changes heading into next season and stated the team would not win the UEFA Champions League as currently constructed.[78] Changes were needed at the club on a very deep level and as such during the pre season for the 2022–23 season the club embarked on an ambitious rebuild, most notably with the hiring of transfer market expert Luís Campos as football advisor.[79]\\n\\nIdentity\\nGermain the lynx, mascot of PSG.\\nGermain the Lynx, the club\\'s official mascot\\nColours and mascot\\nSince their foundation, Paris Saint-Germain have represented both the city of Paris and the nearby royal town of Saint-Germain-en-Laye.[12] As a result, red, blue and white are the club\\'s traditional colours.[80] The red and blue are Parisian colours, a nod to revolutionary figures Lafayette and Jean Sylvain Bailly, and the white is a symbol of French royalty and Saint-Germain-en-Laye.[80][81]\\n\\nOn the club\\'s crest, the Eiffel Tower in red and the blue background represent Paris, while the fleur de lys in white is a hint to the coat of arms of Saint-Germain-en-Laye.[80][81] The fleur de lys is a royal symbol as well and recalls that French King Louis XIV was born in the town.[80] Throughout its history, PSG have brandished several crests, but all of them have featured the club\\'s three historical colours.[82]\\n\\nLikewise, PSG\\'s most iconic shirts have been predominantly red, blue or white, with the remaining two colours included as well.[83] The club\\'s official mascot, Germain the Lynx, also sports PSG\\'s traditional colours.[81] It was unveiled during the 2010 Tournoi de Paris in commemoration of the club\\'s 40th anniversary, and can be seen entertaining kids in the stands of the Parc des Princes or near the pitch with the players during the warm-up.[84]\\n\\nAnthems and mottos\\nFurther information: Paris Saint-Germain FC supporters § Anthems and mottos\\n\"Allez Paris!,\" recorded by Belgian actress and singer Annie Cordy in 1971, was the club\\'s first official anthem. A PSG fan from the start, she was part of an association of hundreds of celebrities who contributed to the foundation of the club in 1970.[85][86] The club\\'s second anthem, \"Allez Paris-Saint-Germain!\" by Les Parisiens, was recorded in 1977, replacing Cordy\\'s version. The brainchild of historical PSG leader and music producer Charles Talar, he produced and released it under his homonym record label.[87][88][89] The song\\'s chorus became a popular chant among PSG supporters during games.[90] A new version, also called \"Allez Paris-Saint-Germain!\", was recorded in 2010 as part of the club\\'s 40th anniversary celebrations. Sung to the tune of \"Go West\" by Village People, the lyrics were rewritten with suggestions made by fans. This is the club\\'s current official anthem.[81][84][88]\\n\\n\"Ô Ville Lumière\" (lit.\\u2009\\'Oh City of Light\\'), to the tune of \"Flower of Scotland\", is another veritable club anthem for PSG supporters.[91][92] Other notable chants from supporters\\' groups in the Boulogne and Auteuil stands include \"Le Parc est à nous\" (lit.\\u2009\\'The Parc is ours\\'), \"Ici, c\\'est Paris!\" (lit.\\u2009\\'This is Paris!\\'), and \"Paris est magique!\" (lit.\\u2009\\'Paris is magical!\\').[81][93] Both stands began exchanging these chants during PSG matches in the 1990s.[90][94][95] \"Ici, c\\'est Paris!\" and \"Paris est magique!\" are also the club\\'s most iconic mottos.[81][96][97] \"Who Said I Would\" by Phill Collins is also a traditional anthem for the fans. The song has accompanied the players\\' entry into the field since 1992.[98]\\n\\nIconic shirts\\n\\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Paris Saint-Germain FC kits.\\nDuring their first three seasons of existence, the home shirt of Paris Saint-Germain was red with blue and white details in its sleeves and neck to bring together the three colours of the club: the red and blue of Paris, and the white of Saint-Germain-en-Laye.[83][99] During the 2010–11 season, PSG wore a red shirt during home matches to commemorate their 40th anniversary.[100]\\n\\nThe connection between Paris Saint-Germain and the city\\'s fashion houses is a longstanding one. French fashion designer Daniel Hechter became PSG president in 1973 and designed the club\\'s traditional home look that same year: a blue shirt with a red vertical stripe flanked by two thinner white stripes (blue-white-red-white-blue).[99][101] First worn in the 1973–74 season, the so-called \"Hechter shirt\" has remained the classic home identity of PSG ever since.[83][102][103][104]\\n\\nThe three most iconic shirts of Paris Saint-Germain Football Club.\\nThe three most iconic shirts of Paris Saint-Germain\\nThe famous jersey made its debut during a home Ligue 2 game against Red Star on 10 November 1973.[105] This was also the club\\'s maiden match at the Parc des Princes. PSG won 3–1 as Othniel Dossevi scored the club\\'s first goal at the stadium as well as the first with the Hechter shirt.[21] PSG stars from the 1990s and 2000s like Raí, Ronaldinho and Pauleta are associated with this kit. While wearing it, the capital club reached five European semi-finals in a row between 1993 and 1997, claimed the 1995–96 UEFA Cup Winners\\' Cup and achieved eight consecutive wins against Le Classique arch-rivals Olympique de Marseille between 2002 and 2004.[83][106]\\n\\nThe general belief is that Hechter based his creation on the red-and-white jersey worn by Ajax, the dominant team in Europe at the time, but with the French flag in mind.[13][99][101] Hechter himself has denied this, though, instead claiming he was inspired by the Ford Mustang. He transposed the car\\'s hood stripes on the shirt and employed the three colours of the club.[99] The Hechter shirt has two alternate versions: the \"reversed Hechter\" (red-white-blue-white-red), introduced in the 1974–75 season, and the \"white Hechter\" (white-blue-red-blue-white), which premiered in the 1994–95 season.[99][104][107]\\n\\nIt was with the club\\'s most iconic away outfit, though, that fans saw the first big PSG team which won their maiden French Cup titles in 1982 and 1983, experienced their first European campaign in 1983, and claimed their maiden Ligue 1 crown in 1986. The shirt was white with blue and red vertical stripes on the left.[83][102] Like the Hechter jersey, it debuted in the 1973–74 season as the away kit.[99] Promoted by PSG president Francis Borelli, the white shirt was the club\\'s home identity from 1981 to 1990.[102] Now known as the \"Borelli shirt,\" it is synonym with PSG legends from the 1980s like Safet Sušić, Luis Fernández and Dominique Bathenay.[83][103][108]\\n\\nIn 2025 shirts included a design in Arabic writing for the first time; they were worn in Doha on 5 January for the Trophée des Champions match.[109][110] The design was created by calligrapher Fatma Al Sharshani.[111]\\n\\nCrest evolution\\nThe club\\'s first crest was basically the same as the original Paris FC (PFC) logo. Having to merge and give birth to PSG using Stade Saint-Germain\\'s stadium, the PFC crest kept its original design but the name below it changed from \"Paris FC\" to \"Paris Saint-Germain Football Club.\" This badge consisted of a blue football with a red vessel inside it. The latter is a historic symbol of Paris and is present in the city\\'s coat of arms. The name of the club was written below in red.[112]\\n\\nLogo du Paris Saint-Germain entre 1992 et 1996.\\nClub crest between 1992 and 1995\\nPSG, however, split from PFC in 1972 and thus needed a new crest. Representing both Paris and Saint-Germain-en-Laye, the club\\'s second crest became the basis of the one the fans know today. The round logo featured the Eiffel Tower in red against a blue background and, underneath it, two Saint-Germain symbols in white: a fleur de lys and Louis XIV\\'s cradle.[112] Created by Christian Lentretien, former PSG board member and publicist by profession, this crest was first used in 1972 and lasted until 1982.[112][113] The Parc des Princes, the club\\'s home stadium, appeared below it between 1982 and 1990.[112]\\n\\nThe stadium was dropped from the crest in 1990. Two years later, then club owners Canal+ radically changed it in 1992. The new model had the acronym \"PSG\" in white against a blue-white-red-white-blue background (like the colour pattern of the Hechter shirt) with \"Paris Saint-Germain\" underneath in white against a black background. Under pressure from supporters, the traditional crest returned in 1995 with \"Paris Saint-Germain\" above the tower and \"1970\" below the cradle. This logo went through a slight facelift in 2002, most notably featuring a darker shade of blue.[112]\\n\\nAt the request of the club\\'s Qatari owners, the traditional crest underwent a major makeover in 2013.[112] \"Paris\" is now written in big white bold letters above a large Eiffel Tower, clearly putting forward the brand \"Paris\" instead of \"Paris Saint-Germain\". Underneath it, \"Saint-Germain\" is written in smaller letters below the fleur de lys.[96][114] The cradle and the club\\'s founding year \"1970\" were left out.[114] PSG deputy general manager Jean-Claude Blanc said: \"We are called Paris Saint-Germain but, above all, we are called Paris\".[96]\\n\\nFriendly tournaments\\nMain articles: Tournoi de Paris and Tournoi Indoor de Paris-Bercy\\nParis Saint-Germain used to host two very famous invitational competitions: the Tournoi de Paris and the Tournoi Indoor de Paris-Bercy.[115][116] Regarded as French football\\'s most prestigious friendly tournament, the Tournoi de Paris is considered a precursor of both the Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup.[115][117] PSG began hosting it in 1975 and were crowned champions a record seven times.[115] Held at the Parc des Princes, the Tournoi de Paris was last organized in 2012.[115][118] The Tournoi Indoor de Paris-Bercy was an indoor football tournament founded by PSG in 1984 and held annually until 1991 at the AccorHotels Arena in the 12th arrondissement of Paris. Played indoors on a synthetic field and featuring seven-a-side teams, the competition featured hosts PSG and five more clubs. The Parisians lifted the trophy on two occasions, more than any other club.[116]\\n\\nGrounds\\nStadiums\\nMain articles: Parc des Princes and Stade Georges Lefèvre\\n\\nThe Parc des Princes in October 2022.\\nSince its inception, Paris Saint-Germain have played in five main stadiums: the Stade Jean-Bouin, the Stade Georges Lefèvre, the Stade Bauer, the Stade Yves-du-Manoir, and the Parc des Princes, their current home ground.[119][120] PSG took on Ligue 2 promotion rivals Red Star on 10 November 1973, for the club\\'s first match at the Parc des Princes.[21][119] It was the curtain-raiser for that season\\'s opening Ligue 1 match between Paris FC and Sochaux.[21] PSG moved into the ground upon its return to Ligue 1 in July 1974, ironically the same year that Paris FC were relegated.[16][119] Up until that point it had hosted Paris FC, who showed reluctance towards PSG playing there.[16][121]\\n\\nFrom that moment on, the Parc des Princes has been the home stadium of PSG.[119] Its most prolific season in terms of average attendance is 2019–20, during which an average of 47,517 spectators went to the stadium for each match.[119][122] The attendance record for a PSG match dates back to 13 March 1983, with 49,575 spectators present in the stands of the Parc des Princes. This match pitted PSG against Belgian side Waterschei for the UEFA Cup Winners\\' Cup quarterfinals. The final score was a 2–0 victory for the Parisians.[123][124]\\n\\nDuring the 1970–71 season, the club played at the Stade Jean-Bouin, concurrently with the Stade Georges Lefèvre.[119] The Jean-Bouin was privileged given that it drew significantly greater levels of fan support.[119][125] The Georges Lefèvre regularly hosted PSG matches from 1972 to 1974 as well.[119] Between 1904 and 1970, it was the home of Stade Saint-Germain, club which merged with Paris FC to form PSG in 1970.[119][126] PSG played again at the Jean-Bouin in 1973–74, alternating their home games with the Georges Lefèvre and the Parc des Princes.[125]\\n\\nPSG played at the Stade de Paris, today known as Stade Bauer, for the first time during the 1971–72 season.[119] It was used again by the club once in 1976–77 and 1977–78, and twice in 1978–79 due to construction work on the lawn of the Parc des Princes.[119][125] Similarly, the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir, as its officially called, welcomed PSG for three matches in 1971–72, once more in 1974–75, and one last time in 1975–76 because the Parc des Princes was under renovation.[119][125]\\n\\nTraining facilities\\nMain articles: Campus PSG and Camp des Loges\\nCampus PSG has been the club\\'s training ground since July 2023.[127] Located in Poissy, it replaced the Camp des Loges, PSG\\'s historical training facility.[127][128] Owned and financed by the club, the venue brings together PSG\\'s male and female football, handball and judo teams, as well as the football and handball academies.[129][130] Each division have its own dedicated facilities.[131] Campus PSG will have a stadium, which will complement the club\\'s home ground of the Parc des Princes.[129] It is due to be built during the second phase of the project, after 2024.[132] PSG\\'s male team moved into Campus PSG on 10 July 2023.[127] They completed their first group training session there on 18 July 2023, and played their first game on 21 July 2023.[133][134] It was a friendly match against Le Havre which ended in a 2–0 victory for PSG.[134]\\n\\nThe Camp des Loges is a training ground located in Saint-Germain-en-Laye.[135] It hosted PSG\\'s male team from July 1970 to June 2023.[128] The venue also turned into the training facilities of the club\\'s academy when it opened on 4 November 1975.[135][128] The current version of the Camp des Loges opened in November 2008, and is the second to have been built on the site, with the first opening its doors in June 1904.[128][135] It was renamed Ooredoo Training Centre, as part of a sponsorship deal with Ooredoo, in September 2013.[128] The complex hosted the training sessions of the club\\'s female team between June 2023 and January 2024.[128][136] The men\\'s team left the Camp des Loges for Campus PSG in July 2023.[127] The club\\'s academy and female team moved to the new site in January 2024.[136][137] Rugby union club Stade Français are expected to become the new tenants of the Camp des Loges in the summer of 2024.[138]\\n\\nRecords and statistics\\nMain article: List of Paris Saint-Germain FC records and statistics\\nSee also: List of Paris Saint-Germain FC seasons and Paris Saint-Germain FC in international football\\n\\nPSG\\'s starting lineup ahead of a UEFA Champions League match away to Dynamo Kyiv during the 2012–13 season\\nParis Saint-Germain holds many records, most notably being the most successful French club in history in terms of official titles won, with 50.[1][49][139] They are the record holders of all national competitions, having clinched twelve Ligue 1 championships, fourteen Coupe de France, nine Coupe de la Ligue, and twelve Trophée des Champions. Their trophy cabinet also includes one Ligue 2 title.[49][140] In international football, PSG have claimed one UEFA Cup Winners\\' Cup and one UEFA Intertoto Cup.[49]\\n\\nTheir victory in the 1995–96 UEFA Cup Winners\\' Cup makes PSG the sole French side to have won this trophy, one of only two French clubs to have won a major European competition, and the youngest European team to do so.[46][141] They are also the only side to have won the Ligue 1 title after being at the top of the table from the first until the last round (2022–23),[142] the Coupe de France without conceding a single goal (1992–93 and 2016–17),[143] five Coupe de la Ligue in a row (2014–2018),[144] four back-to-back Coupe de France (2015–2018),[145] and eight consecutive Trophée des Champions (2013–2020).[146]\\n\\nPSG have won all four national titles in a single season on four occasions. This feat is known as the domestic quadruple. The Red and Blues have completed the domestic double, the league and league cup double, the domestic cup double, the domestic treble and the league three-peat several times as well. Therefore, PSG are the club with the most domestic doubles and league and league cup doubles, one of two sides to have achieved the league three-peat twice, and the only team to have won the domestic cup double, the domestic treble and the domestic quadruple.[49]\\n\\nSince their inception, PSG have completed 53 seasons, of which 50 have been played in the highest division in French football, known as Ligue 1.[1][125][147][148] In 2022–23, they celebrated their 49th consecutive campaign in Ligue 1, which makes them the competitions\\'s longest-serving club.[148][149] PSG have played continuously in Ligue 1 from the 1974–75 season onwards.[148][149] Since then, the Parisians have won twelve league titles, finishing first more frequently than in any other position.[148] Having come second in nine league campaigns, PSG have therefore made up the top two spots on 21 occasions.[148] They have also reached the top five 29 times, which represents more than half of the club\\'s seasons in Ligue 1.[148] PSG\\'s lowest-ever finish is 16th, both in 1971–72 (their first in Ligue 1) and 2007–08, when they escaped relegation on the final day of the season, with a 2–1 win at Sochaux.[148]\\n\\nSupporters\\nMain article: Paris Saint-Germain FC supporters\\nOM-PSG en finale de la coupe de la France en 2006.\\nPSG fans before the 2006 French Cup final against Marseille.\\nParis Saint-Germain are the most popular football club in France, with 22% of fans identifying as Parisians. Marseille come second with 20%, while Lyon are third with 14%.[150] PSG are also one of the most widely supported teams with 35 million supporters worldwide, more than any other French club.[151] The Parc des Princes has been the home stadium of the club since July 1974.[119] It has four stands: Tribune Borelli, Tribune Auteuil, Tribune Paris and Tribune Boulogne.[152] Historically, the Auteuil and Boulogne stands, better known as Virage Auteuil (VA) and Kop of Boulogne (KoB), have housed PSG\\'s most hardcore supporters\\' groups, the so-called ultras, which have made the Parc one of Europe\\'s most feared venues as well as one of the best in terms of atmosphere.[153][154][155] Other more friendly, family-oriented groups have usually gathered in the Paris and Borelli stands.[156]\\n\\nLacking a big passionate fanbase, the club began offering cheaper season tickets to young supporters in 1976. These fans were placed in the Kop K, located in the K section of the Paris stand at the Parc des Princes.[93][157] Following an increase in ticket prices, Kop K supporters moved to the Boulogne stand in 1978, and the Kop of Boulogne was born.[93][158][159] There, the club\\'s first Italian-style ultra group, Boulogne Boys, were founded in 1985,[159][160][161] followed by English-inspired kopistes Gavroches and Rangers. However, several KoB groups, including Commando Pirate and Casual Firm, took English hooligans as dubious role models and violence rapidly escalated.[156][162]\\n\\nIn response, club owners Canal+ encouraged non-violent KoB fans to take place in the Auteuil stand at the other end of the stadium, giving birth to the Virage Auteuil in 1991, spearheaded by ultra groups Supras Auteuil, Lutece Falco and Tigris Mystic.[156][158][163] The measure worked at first but, slowly, a violent, racially motivated rivalry arose between the two stands.[158][163][164] Things came to a head in 2010 before a match against Marseille. Boulogne fan Yann Lorence was killed following a fight between groups from both stands outside the Parc, forcing PSG president Robin Leproux to take action.[158][165] In what was known as Plan Leproux, the club exiled all groups from the Parc and banned them from away matches as well.[154] It took six years for the ultras to reclaim their place in the stadium. Former VA supporters formed the Collectif Ultras Paris (CUP) in February 2016, and the club agreed to their return in October 2016.[154][165][166]\\n\\nPSG have granted official status to 16 groups at the Parc des Princes since 1975.[167][168][169][170] Based in Auteuil, the CUP are currently the only ultra group officially recognized by the club.[155][170] They share the stadium with fellow authorized groups Les Amis du PSG, Hoolicool, PSG Grand Sud, Vikings 27 and Handicap-PSG in the Paris stand; and Titi Fosi in the Borelli stand.[167][168][169] In the past, PSG also acknowledged Boulogne Boys, Gavroches, Rangers and Brigade Paris from Boulogne; and Supras Auteuil, Lutece Falco, Tigris Mystic, Authentiks and Puissance Paris from Auteuil.[167][168] More recently, unofficial ultra groups Block Parisii and Résistance Parisienne have settled at Boulogne and are trying to convince the club of relaunching the KoB.[156][171][172] Other active associations include former CUP members Karsud, which were excluded from the group in 2017, and therefore vetoed from all club matches, due to accusations of hooliganism.[156][173][174] They are the club\\'s last remaining organized hooligan group.[156][174]\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'Liverpool F.C.': 'Liverpool Football Club is a professional football club based in Liverpool, England. The club competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. Founded in 1892, the club joined the Football League the following year and has played its home games at Anfield since its formation. Liverpool is one of the most valuable and widely supported clubs in the world.\\n\\nDomestically, the club has won nineteen league titles, eight FA Cups, a record ten League Cups and sixteen FA Community Shields. In international competitions, the club has won six European Cups, three UEFA Cups, four UEFA Super Cups—all English records—and one FIFA Club World Cup. Liverpool established itself as a major force in domestic football in the 1960s under Bill Shankly, before becoming perennial title challengers at home and abroad under Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Kenny Dalglish who led the club to a combined eleven league titles and four European Cups through the 1970s and 80s. Liverpool won two further European Cups in 2005 and 2019 under the management of Rafael Benítez and Jürgen Klopp, respectively; the latter led Liverpool to a 19th league title in 2020, the club\\'s first during the Premier League era.\\n\\nAlready nicknamed \"The Reds\", it was under Shankly in the 60s that the team first adopted the distinctive all-red home strip which has been used ever since. Also adopted under Shankly\\'s tenure was the club\\'s anthem \"You\\'ll Never Walk Alone\". The Reds compete in the local Merseyside derby against fellow Liverpool club Everton, often referred to simply as \"The Blues\". As the two most decorated clubs in England, and inter-city rivals, Liverpool also has a long-standing rivalry with the Manchester club Manchester United.\\n\\nThe club\\'s supporters have been involved in two major tragedies. The Heysel Stadium disaster, where escaping fans were pressed against a collapsing wall at the 1985 European Cup Final in Brussels, resulted in 39 deaths, most of which were Italians and Juventus fans. Liverpool were given a six-year ban from European competitions, and all other English clubs received a five-year ban. The Hillsborough disaster in 1989, where 97 Liverpool supporters died in a crowd crush against perimeter fencing, led to the elimination of fenced standing terraces in favour of all-seater stadiums in the top two tiers of English football. Prolonged campaigning for justice saw further coroner\\'s inquests, commissions and independent panels that ultimately exonerated the fans.\\n\\nHistory\\nMain articles: 1892–1959, 1959–85, and 1985–present\\nBlack and white photograph of elder and bald John Houlding, wearing beard and bow tie.\\nJohn Houlding, the founder of Liverpool F.C.\\nLiverpool were founded following a dispute between the Everton committee and John Houlding, club president and owner of the land at Anfield. After eight years at the stadium, Everton relocated to Goodison Park in 1892 and Houlding founded Liverpool F.C. to play at Anfield.[2] Originally named \"Everton F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd\" (Everton Athletic for short), the club became Liverpool F.C. in March 1892 and gained official recognition three months later, after The Football Association refused to recognise the club as Everton.[3]\\n\\nLiverpool played their first match on 1 September 1892, a pre-season friendly match against Rotherham Town, which they won 7–1. The team Liverpool fielded against Rotherham was composed entirely of Scottish players—the players who came from Scotland to play in England in those days were known as the Scotch Professors. Manager John McKenna had recruited the players after a scouting trip to Scotland—so they became known as the \"team of Macs\".[4] The team won the Lancashire League in its debut season and joined the Football League Second Division at the start of the 1893–94 season. After the club was promoted to the First Division in 1896, Tom Watson was appointed manager. He led Liverpool to its first league title in 1901, before winning it again in 1906.[5]\\n\\nLiverpool reached their first FA Cup Final in 1914, losing 1–0 to Burnley. It won consecutive League championships in 1922 and 1923, but did not win another trophy until the 1946–47 season, when the club won the First Division for a fifth time under the control of ex-West Ham United centre half George Kay.[6] Liverpool suffered its second Cup Final defeat in 1950, playing against Arsenal.[7] The club was relegated to the Second Division in the 1953–54 season.[8] Soon after Liverpool lost 2–1 to non-league Worcester City in the 1958–59 FA Cup, Bill Shankly was appointed manager. Upon his arrival he released 24 players and converted a boot storage room at Anfield into a room where the coaches could discuss strategy; here, Shankly and other \"Boot Room\" members Joe Fagan, Reuben Bennett, and Bob Paisley began reshaping the team.[9]\\n\\nStatue of a man with his arms held aloft\\nStatue of Bill Shankly outside Anfield. Shankly won promotion to the First Division and the club\\'s first league title since 1947.\\nThe club was promoted back into the First Division in 1962 and won it in 1964, for the first time in 17 years. In 1965, the club won its first FA Cup. In 1966, the club won the First Division but lost to Borussia Dortmund in the European Cup Winners\\' Cup final.[10] Liverpool won both the League and the UEFA Cup during the 1972–73 season, and the FA Cup again a year later. Shankly retired soon afterwards and was replaced by his assistant, Bob Paisley.[11] In 1976, Paisley\\'s second season as manager, the club won another League and UEFA Cup double. The following season, the club retained the League title and won the European Cup for the first time, but it lost in the 1977 FA Cup Final. Liverpool retained the European Cup in 1978 and regained the First Division title in 1979.[12] During Paisley\\'s nine seasons as manager Liverpool won 20 trophies, including three European Cups, a UEFA Cup, six League titles and three consecutive League Cups; the only domestic trophy he did not win was the FA Cup.[13]\\n\\n\\nStatue of Bob Paisley carrying the injured former Liverpool captain Emlyn Hughes outside Anfield. Paisley remains the most successful manager in the club\\'s history.\\nPaisley retired in 1983 and was replaced by his assistant, Joe Fagan.[14] Liverpool won the League, League Cup and European Cup in Fagan\\'s first season, becoming the first English side to win three trophies in a season.[15] Liverpool reached the European Cup final again in 1985, against Juventus at the Heysel Stadium. Before kick-off, Liverpool fans breached a fence that separated the two groups of supporters and charged the Juventus fans. The resulting weight of people caused a retaining wall to collapse, killing 39 fans, mostly Italians. The incident became known as the Heysel Stadium disaster. The match was played in spite of protests by both managers, and Liverpool lost 1–0 to Juventus. As a result of the tragedy, English clubs were banned from participating in European competition for five years; Liverpool received a ten-year ban, which was later reduced to six years. Fourteen Liverpool fans received convictions for involuntary manslaughter.[16]\\n\\nFagan had announced his retirement just before the disaster and Kenny Dalglish was appointed as player-manager.[17] During his tenure, the club won another three league titles and two FA Cups, including a League and Cup \"Double\" in the 1985–86 season. Liverpool\\'s success was overshadowed by the Hillsborough disaster: in an FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989, hundreds of Liverpool fans were crushed against perimeter fencing.[18] Ninety-four fans died that day; the 95th victim died in hospital from his injuries four days later, the 96th died nearly four years later, without regaining consciousness, and the 97th, Andrew Devine, died in 2021 of injuries sustained in the disaster.[19][20] After the Hillsborough disaster there was a government review of stadium safety. The resulting Taylor Report paved the way for legislation that required top-division teams to have all-seater stadiums. The report ruled that the main reason for the disaster was overcrowding due to a failure of police control.[21]\\n\\n3 burgundy tablets with gold engraved writing.

Liverpool finished equal with Arsenal on both points and goal difference, but lost the title on total goals scored when Arsenal scored the final goal in the last minute of the season.[22]\\n\\nDalglish cited the Hillsborough disaster and its repercussions as the reason for his resignation in 1991; he was replaced by former player Graeme Souness.[23] Under his leadership Liverpool won the 1992 FA Cup Final, but their league performances slumped, with two consecutive sixth-place finishes, eventually resulting in his dismissal in January 1994. Souness was replaced by Roy Evans, and Liverpool went on to win the 1995 Football League Cup Final.[24] While they made some title challenges under Evans, third-place finishes in 1996 and 1998 were the best they could manage, and so Gérard Houllier was appointed co-manager in the 1998–99 season, and became the sole manager in November 1998 after Evans resigned.[25] In 2001, Houllier\\'s second full season in charge, Liverpool won a \"treble\": the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup.[26] Houllier underwent major heart surgery during the 2001–02 season and Liverpool finished second in the League, behind Arsenal.[27] They won a further League Cup in 2003, but failed to mount a title challenge in the two seasons that followed.[28][29]\\n\\nA silver trophy with red ribbons on it\\nThe European Cup, trophy won by Liverpool for a fifth time in 2005.\\nHoullier was replaced by Rafael Benítez at the end of the 2003–04 season. Despite finishing fifth in Benítez\\'s first season, Liverpool won the 2004–05 UEFA Champions League, beating A.C. Milan 3–2 in a penalty shootout after the match ended with a score of 3–3.[30] The following season, Liverpool finished third in the Premier League and won the 2006 FA Cup Final, beating West Ham United in a penalty shootout after the match finished 3–3.[31] American businessmen George Gillett and Tom Hicks became the owners of the club during the 2006–07 season, in a deal which valued the club and its outstanding debts at £218.9 million.[32] The club reached the 2007 UEFA Champions League Final against Milan, as it had in 2005, but lost 2–1.[33] During the 2008–09 season Liverpool achieved 86 points, its then-highest Premier League points total, prior to the record-breaking 2018–19 season, and finished as runners up to Manchester United.[34]\\n\\nIn the 2009–10 season, Liverpool finished seventh in the Premier League and failed to qualify for the Champions League. Benítez subsequently left by mutual consent[35] and was replaced by Fulham manager Roy Hodgson.[36] At the start of the 2010–11 season Liverpool was on the verge of bankruptcy and the club\\'s creditors asked the High Court to allow the sale of the club, overruling the wishes of Hicks and Gillett. John W. Henry, owner of the Boston Red Sox and of Fenway Sports Group, bid successfully for the club and took ownership in October 2010.[37] Poor results during the start of that season led to Hodgson leaving the club by mutual consent and former player and manager Kenny Dalglish taking over.[38] In the 2011–12 season, Liverpool secured a record eighth League Cup success and reached the FA Cup final, but finished in eighth position, the worst league finish in 18 years; this led to the sacking of Dalglish.[39][40] He was replaced by Brendan Rodgers,[41] whose Liverpool team in the 2013–14 season mounted an unexpected title charge to finish second behind champions Manchester City and subsequently return to the Champions League, scoring 101 goals in the process, the most since the 106 scored in the 1895–96 season.[42][43] Following a disappointing 2014–15 season, where Liverpool finished sixth in the league, and a poor start to the following campaign, Rodgers was sacked in October 2015.[44]\\n\\n\\nMohamed Salah is Liverpool\\'s third-leading goalscorer in club history, behind Ian Rush and Roger Hunt, and the club\\'s leading goalscorer in the Premier League era.\\nRodgers was replaced by Jürgen Klopp.[45] Liverpool reached the finals of the Football League Cup and UEFA Europa League in Klopp\\'s first season, finishing as runner-up in both competitions.[46] The club finished second in the 2018–19 season with 97 points (surpassing the 86 points gained during the 2008–09 season), losing only one game: a points record for a non-title winning side.[47] Klopp took Liverpool to successive Champions League finals in 2018 and 2019, with the club defeating Tottenham Hotspur 2–0 to win the 2019 UEFA Champions League Final.[48][49] Liverpool beat Flamengo of Brazil in the final 1–0 to win the FIFA Club World Cup for the first time.[50] Liverpool then went on to win the 2019–20 Premier League, winning their first top-flight league title in thirty years.[51] The club set multiple records in the season, including winning the league with seven games remaining making it the earliest any team has ever won the title,[52] amassing a club record 99 points, and achieving a joint-record 32 wins in a top-flight season.[53] The 2021–22 season saw the club win the domestic cup double, the FA Cup and the League Cup.[54] In January 2024, Klopp announced that he would leave the club at the end of the season, and he won his final trophy with the club, the League Cup, the following month.[55][56]\\n\\nOn 20 May 2024, Arne Slot was announced as Klopp\\'s successor, becoming head coach on 1 June.[57]\\n\\nColours and badge\\nA blue and white shirt and white shorts\\nLiverpool\\'s home colours worn from 1892 to 1896[58]\\n\\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Liverpool F.C. kits.\\nFor much of Liverpool\\'s history, its home colours have been all red. When the club was founded in 1892, blue and white quartered shirts were used until the club adopted the city\\'s colour of red in 1896.[2] The city\\'s symbol of the liver bird was adopted as the club\\'s badge (or crest, as it is sometimes known) in 1901, although it was not incorporated into the kit until 1955. Liverpool continued to wear red shirts and white shorts until 1964 when manager Bill Shankly decided to change to an all-red strip.[58] Liverpool played in all red for the first time against Anderlecht, as Ian St John recalled in his autobiography:\\n\\nHe [Shankly] thought the colour scheme would carry psychological impact – red for danger, red for power. He came into the dressing room one day and threw a pair of red shorts to Ronnie Yeats. \"Get into those shorts and let\\'s see how you look\", he said. \"Christ, Ronnie, you look awesome, terrifying. You look 7 ft tall.\" \"Why not go the whole hog, boss?\" I suggested. \"Why not wear red socks? Let\\'s go out all in red.\" Shankly approved and an iconic kit was born.[59]\\n\\nThe Liverpool away strip has more often than not been all yellow or white shirts and black shorts, but there have been several exceptions. An all grey kit was introduced in 1987, which was used until the 1991–92 centenary season when it was replaced by a combination of green shirts and white shorts. After various colour combinations in the 1990s, including gold and navy, bright yellow, black and grey, and ecru, the club alternated between yellow and white away kits until the 2008–09 season, when it re-introduced the grey kit. A third kit is designed for European away matches, though it is also worn in domestic away matches on occasions when the current away kit clashes with a team\\'s home kit. Between 2012 and 2015, the kits were designed by Warrior Sports, who became the club\\'s kit providers at the start of the 2012–13 season.[60] In February 2015, Warrior\\'s parent company New Balance announced it would be entering the global football market, with teams sponsored by Warrior now being outfitted by New Balance.[61] The only other branded shirts worn by the club were made by Umbro until 1985, when they were replaced by Adidas, who produced the kits until 1996 when Reebok took over. They produced the kits for 10 years before Adidas made the kits from 2006 to 2012.[62] Nike became the club\\'s official kit supplier at the start of the 2020–21 season.[63] In 2025, the club reunited with Adidas in a multi-year partnership.[64]\\n\\n\\nA version of Liverpool\\'s badge as depicted on the Shankly Gates\\nLiverpool was the first English professional club to have a sponsor\\'s logo on its shirts, after agreeing a deal with Hitachi in 1979.[65] However, for the first few years of the deal, broadcasting rules meant that sponsors logos could not be shown on shirts for televised matches.[66]\\n\\nSince then, the club has been sponsored by Crown Paints, Candy, Carlsberg and Standard Chartered. The contract with Carlsberg, which was signed in 1992, was the longest-lasting agreement in English top-flight football.[67] The association with Carlsberg ended at the start of the 2010–11 season, when Standard Chartered Bank became the club\\'s sponsor.[68]\\n\\nThe Liverpool badge is based on the city\\'s liver bird symbol, which in the past had been placed inside a shield. In 1977, a red liver bird standing on a football (blazoned as \"Statant upon a football a Liver Bird wings elevated and addorsed holding in the beak a piece of seaweed gules\") was granted as a heraldic badge by the College of Arms to the English Football League intended for use by Liverpool. However, Liverpool never made use of this badge.[69] In 1992, to commemorate the centennial of the club, a new badge was commissioned, including a representation of the Shankly Gates. The next year twin flames were added at either side, symbolic of the Hillsborough memorial outside Anfield, where an eternal flame burns in memory of those who died in the Hillsborough disaster.[70] In 2012, Warrior Sports\\' first Liverpool kit removed the shield and gates, returning the badge to what had adorned Liverpool shirts in the 1970s; the flames were moved to the back collar of the shirt, surrounding the number 96 for the number who died at Hillsborough.[71] Following the death of Andrew Devine and the subsequent ruling by a coroner that he was unlawfully killed, the number 97 has been worn in this place since the beginning of the 2022–23 season.[72]\\n\\nStadium\\nMain article: Anfield\\nFor information on Liverpool\\'s abandoned proposed new stadium, see Stanley Park Stadium.\\nThe interior of a stadium.\\nAnfield, home of Liverpool F.C.\\nLiverpool\\'s home stadium is Anfield, which was built in 1884 on land adjacent to Stanley Park. Situated 2 miles (3 km) from Liverpool city centre, it was originally used by Everton before the latter moved to Goodison Park after a dispute over rent with Anfield owner John Houlding.[73] Left with an empty ground, Houlding founded Liverpool in 1892 and the club has played at Anfield ever since. The capacity of the stadium at the time was 20,000, although only 100 spectators attended Liverpool\\'s first match at Anfield.[74]\\n\\nThe Kop is the stadium section where Liverpool\\'s most vocal supporters, often referred to as \"Kopites,\" have traditionally gathered.[75] Historically, the Kop was a terraced stand before it was converted to seating, and it has long been recognized as the heart of Anfield\\'s fan base. It was originally built in 1906 due to the high turnout for matches and was called the Oakfield Road Embankment. Its first game was on 1 September 1906 when the home side beat Stoke City 1–0.[76] In 1906, the banked stand at one end of the ground was formally renamed the Spion Kop after a hill in KwaZulu-Natal.[77] The hill was the site of the Battle of Spion Kop in the Second Boer War, where over 300 men of the Lancashire Regiment died, many of them from Liverpool.[78] At its peak, the stand could hold 28,000 spectators and was one of the largest single-tier stands in the world. Many stadiums in England had stands named after Spion Kop, but Anfield\\'s was the largest of them at the time; it could hold more supporters than some entire football grounds.[79]\\n\\nAnfield could accommodate more than 60,000 supporters at its peak and had a capacity of 55,000 until the 1990s, when, following recommendations from the Taylor Report, all clubs in the Premier League were obliged to convert to all-seater stadiums in time for the 1993–94 season, reducing its capacity to 45,276.[80] The findings of the report precipitated the redevelopment of the Kemlyn Road Stand, which was rebuilt in 1992, coinciding with the centenary of the club, and was known as the Centenary Stand until 2017 when it was renamed the Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand. An extra tier was added to the Anfield Road end in 1998, which further increased the capacity of the ground but gave rise to problems when it was opened. A series of support poles and stanchions were inserted to give extra stability to the top tier of the stand after movement of the tier was reported at the start of the 1999–2000 season.[81]\\n\\nBecause of restrictions on expanding the capacity at Anfield, Liverpool announced plans to move to the proposed Stanley Park Stadium in May 2002.[82] Planning permission was granted in July 2004,[83] and in September 2006, Liverpool City Council agreed to grant Liverpool a 999-year lease on the proposed site.[84] Following the takeover of the club by George Gillett and Tom Hicks in February 2007, the proposed stadium was redesigned. The new design was approved by the Council in November 2007. The stadium was scheduled to open in August 2011 and would hold 60,000 spectators, with HKS, Inc. contracted to build the stadium.[85] Construction was halted in August 2008, as Gillett and Hicks had difficulty in financing the £300 million needed for the development.[86] In October 2012, BBC Sport reported that Fenway Sports Group, the new owners of Liverpool, had decided to redevelop their current home at Anfield stadium, rather than building a new stadium in Stanley Park. As part of the redevelopment, the capacity of Anfield was to increase from 45,276 to approximately 60,000 and would cost approximately £150m.[87] When construction was completed on the new Main stand, the capacity of Anfield was increased to 54,074. This £100 million expansion added a third tier to the stand. This was all part of a £260 million project to improve the Anfield area. Jürgen Klopp the manager at the time described the stand as \"impressive\".[88]\\n\\nIn June 2021, it was reported that Liverpool City Council had given planning permission for the club to renovate and expand the Anfield Road stand, boosting the capacity by around 7,000 and taking the overall capacity at Anfield to 61,000. The expansion, which is estimated to cost £60m, was described as \"a huge milestone\" by managing director Andy Hughes, and would also see rail seating being trialled in the Kop for the 2021–22 Premier League season.[89] The first league game to feature an attendance of over 60,000 at Anfield, following the near completion of the Anfield Road stand redevelopment, was a Premier League match against Brighton on 31 March 2024.[90]\\n\\nSupport\\nA single-tiered stand that contains thousands of people.

In front of the stand is a grass pitch with a goal.\\nKopites in The Kop Stand\\nLiverpool is one of the best supported clubs in the world.[91][92] The club states that its worldwide fan base includes 300 officially recognised Supporters Clubs in 100 countries.[93] Notable groups include Spirit of Shankly.[93] The club takes advantage of this support through its worldwide summer tours,[94] which has included playing in front of 101,000 in Michigan, U.S., and 95,000 in Melbourne, Australia.[95][96] The club also has a significant following on social media, and in 2024, it became the first Premier League club (and the third sports team in the world, after Barcelona and Real Madrid) to amass 10 million subscribers on YouTube.[97][98] Liverpool fans often refer to themselves as Kopites, a reference to the fans who once stood, and now sit, on the Kop at Anfield.[99] In 2008, a group of fans formed a splinter club, A.F.C. Liverpool, to play matches for fans who had been priced out of watching Premier League football.[100]\\n\\nThe song \"You\\'ll Never Walk Alone\", originally from the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Carousel and later recorded by Liverpool musicians Gerry and the Pacemakers, is the club\\'s anthem and has been sung by the Anfield crowd since the early 1960s.[101] Simon Hart of The Independent wrote: \"The pre-match, scarfs-raised, sing-it-loud ritual is as much a part of Liverpool\\'s fabric as their red shirts.\"[101] The song\\'s title adorns the top of the Shankly Gates, which were unveiled on 2 August 1982 in memory of former manager Bill Shankly. The \"You\\'ll Never Walk Alone\" portion of the Shankly Gates is also reproduced on the club\\'s badge.[102]\\n\\nDesign of the top of a set of gates, with the sky visible. The inscription on the gates reads \"You\\'ll Never Walk Alone\".\\nThe Shankly Gates, erected in honour of former manager Bill Shankly\\nThe club\\'s supporters have been involved in two stadium disasters. The first was the 1985 Heysel Stadium disaster, in which 39 people, mostly Italians and Juventus supporters, were killed. They were confined to a corner by Liverpool fans who had charged in their direction; the weight of the cornered fans caused a wall to collapse. UEFA laid the blame for the incident solely on the Liverpool supporters,[103] and banned all English clubs from European competition for five years. Liverpool was banned for an additional year, preventing it from participating in the 1990–91 European Cup, even though it won the League in 1990.[104] Twenty-seven fans were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and were extradited to Belgium in 1987 to face trial.[105] In 1989, after a five-month trial in Belgium, 14 Liverpool fans were given three-year sentences for involuntary manslaughter;[106] half of the terms were suspended.[107]\\n\\nThe second disaster took place during an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield, on 15 April 1989. Ninety-seven Liverpool fans died as a consequence of overcrowding at the Leppings Lane end, in what became known as the Hillsborough disaster. In the following days, The Sun\\'s coverage of the event spread falsehoods, particularly an article entitled \"The Truth\" that claimed that Liverpool fans had robbed the dead and had urinated on and attacked the police.[108] Subsequent investigations proved the allegations false, leading to a boycott of the newspaper by Liverpool fans across the city and elsewhere; many still refuse to buy The Sun 30 years later.[109] Many support organisations were set up in the wake of the disaster, such as the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, which represents bereaved families, survivors and supporters in their efforts to secure justice.[110]\\n\\nRivalries\\nMain articles: Merseyside derby and Liverpool F.C.–Manchester United F.C. rivalry\\n\\nLiverpool players (in grey) during the 4–1 win against Manchester United at Old Trafford on 14 March 2009.\\nLiverpool\\'s longest-established rivalry is with fellow Liverpool team Everton, against whom they contest the Merseyside derby. The rivalry stems from Liverpool\\'s formation and the dispute with Everton officials and the then owners of Anfield.[111] The Merseyside derby is one of the few local derbies which do not enforce fan segregation, and hence has been known as the \"friendly derby\".[112] Since the mid-1980s, the rivalry has intensified both on and off the field and, since the inception of the Premier League in 1992, the Merseyside derby has had more players sent off than any other Premier League game. It has been referred to as \"the most ill-disciplined and explosive fixture in the Premier League\".[113] In terms of support within the city, the number of Liverpool fans outweighs Everton supporters by a ratio of 2:1.[114]\\n\\nLiverpool\\'s rivalry with Manchester United stems from the cities\\' competition in the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century.[115] Connected by the world\\'s first inter-city railway, by road Liverpool and Manchester are separated by approximately 30 miles (48 km) along the East Lancs Road.[116] Ranked the two biggest clubs in England by France Football magazine, Liverpool and Manchester United are the most successful English teams in both domestic and international competitions, and both clubs have a global fanbase.[117][118] Viewed as one of the biggest rivalries in world football, it is considered the most famous fixture in English football.[119][120][121] The two clubs alternated as champions between 1964 and 1967,[122] and Manchester United became the first English team to win the European Cup in 1968, followed by Liverpool\\'s four European Cup victories.[123] Despite the 39 league titles and nine European Cups between them, the two rivals have rarely been successful at the same time – Liverpool\\'s run of titles in the 1970s and 1980s coincided with Manchester United\\'s 26-year title drought while United\\'s success in the Premier League-era coincided with Liverpool\\'s 30-year title drought,[124] with the two clubs having finished first and second in the league only five times.[122] Such is the rivalry between the clubs that they rarely do transfer business with each other. The last player to be transferred between the two clubs was Phil Chisnall, who moved to Liverpool from Manchester United in 1964.[125]\\n\\nOwnership and finances\\nAs the owner of Anfield and founder of Liverpool, John Houlding was the club\\'s first chairman, a position he held from its founding in 1892 until 1904. John McKenna took over as chairman after Houlding\\'s departure.[126] McKenna subsequently became President of the Football League.[127] The chairmanship changed hands many times before John Smith, whose father was a shareholder of the club, took up the role in 1973. He oversaw the most successful period in Liverpool\\'s history before stepping down in 1990.[128] His successor was Noel White who became chairman in 1990.[129] In August 1991 David Moores, whose family had owned the club for more than 50 years, became chairman. His uncle John Moores was also a shareholder at Liverpool and was chairman of Everton from 1961 to 1973. Moores owned 51 percent of the club, and in 2004 expressed his willingness to consider a bid for his shares in Liverpool.[130]\\n\\nMoores eventually sold the club to American businessmen George Gillett and Tom Hicks on 6 February 2007. The deal valued the club and its outstanding debts at £218.9 million. The pair paid £5,000 per share, or £174.1m for the total shareholding and £44.8m to cover the club\\'s debts.[131] Disagreements between Gillett and Hicks, and the fans\\' lack of support for them, resulted in the pair looking to sell the club.[132] Martin Broughton was appointed chairman of the club on 16 April 2010 to oversee its sale.[133] In May 2010, accounts were released showing the holding company of the club to be £350m in debt (due to leveraged takeover) with losses of £55m, causing auditor KPMG to qualify its audit opinion.[134] The group\\'s creditors, including the Royal Bank of Scotland, took Gillett and Hicks to court to force them to allow the board to proceed with the sale of the club, the major asset of the holding company. A High Court judge, Mr Justice Floyd, ruled in favour of the creditors and paved the way for the sale of the club to Fenway Sports Group (formerly New England Sports Ventures), although Gillett and Hicks still had the option to appeal.[135] Liverpool was sold to Fenway Sports Group on 15 October 2010 for £300m.[136]\\n\\nLiverpool has been described as a global brand; a 2010 report valued the club\\'s trademarks and associated intellectual property at £141m, an increase of £5m on the previous year. Liverpool was given a brand rating of AA (Very Strong).[137] In April 2010, business magazine Forbes ranked Liverpool as the sixth most valuable football team in the world, behind Manchester United, Real Madrid, Arsenal, Barcelona and Bayern Munich; they valued the club at $822m (£532m), excluding debt.[138] Accountants Deloitte ranked Liverpool eighth in the Deloitte Football Money League, which ranks the world\\'s football clubs in terms of revenue. Liverpool\\'s income in the 2009–10 season was €225.3m.[139] According to a 2018 report by Deloitte, the club had an annual revenue of €424.2 million for the previous year,[140] and Forbes valued the club at $1.944 billion.[141] In 2018, annual revenue increased to €513.7 million,[142] and Forbes valued the club at $2.183 billion.[143] In 2019, revenue increased to €604 million (£533 million) according to Deloitte, with the club breaching the half a billion pounds mark.[144]\\n\\nIn April 2020, the owners of the club came under fire from fans and the media for deciding to furlough all non-playing staff during the COVID-19 pandemic.[145] In response to this, the club made a U-turn on the decision and apologised for their initial decision.[146] In April 2021, Forbes valued the club at $4.1 billion, a two-year increase of 88%, making it the world\\'s fifth-most-valuable football club.[147] Based on the latest rankings by Forbes, as of May 2023, Liverpool is ranked as the fourth most valuable football club in the world, behind Real Madrid, Manchester United and Barcelona; they valued the club at $5.29 billion, an increase of 19% from 2022.[148]\\n\\nLiverpool in the media\\nLiverpool featured in the first edition of BBC\\'s Match of the Day, which screened highlights of their match against Arsenal at Anfield on 22 August 1964. The first football match to be televised in colour was between Liverpool and West Ham United, broadcast live in March 1967.[149] Liverpool fans featured in the Pink Floyd song \"Fearless\", in which they sang excerpts from \"You\\'ll Never Walk Alone\".[150] To mark the club\\'s appearance in the 1988 FA Cup Final, Liverpool released the \"Anfield Rap\", a song featuring John Barnes and other members of the squad.[151]\\n\\nA docudrama on the Hillsborough disaster, written by Jimmy McGovern, was screened in 1996. It featured Christopher Eccleston as Trevor Hicks, who lost two teenage daughters in the disaster, went on to campaign for safer stadiums, and helped to form the Hillsborough Families Support Group.[152] Liverpool featured in the 2001 film The 51st State, in which ex-hitman Felix DeSouza (Robert Carlyle) is a keen supporter of the team and the last scene takes place at a match between Liverpool and Manchester United.[153] The club also featured in the 1984 children\\'s television show Scully, about a young boy who tries to gain a trial with Liverpool.[154] The Doctor Who episode \"The Halloween Apocalypse\", aired in October 2021, features The Doctor (played by Jodie Whittaker) exiting the TARDIS outside Anfield, as she exclaims: \"Liverpool?

       " 'Chelsea F.C.': 'Chelsea Football Club is a professional football club based in Fulham, West London, England. Named after neighbouring area Chelsea, they compete in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. Founded in 1905, the team play their home games at Stamford Bridge.[4] The club won their first major honour, the League championship, in 1955. They won the FA Cup for the first time in 1970, won their first European honour, the Cup Winners\\' Cup, in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022.\\n\\nChelsea is one of five clubs and the first English club to have won all three pre-1999 main European club competitions, the \"European Treble\" of the European Cup/UEFA Champions League, European/UEFA Cup Winners\\' Cup, and UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League.[5] They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice. They are the only London club to have won the Champions League and the Club World Cup.[6] Domestically, the club has won six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, they have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners\\' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once. In terms of overall trophies won, Chelsea is the fifth-most successful club in English football.\\n\\nThe club has rivalries with fellow London teams Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur, and a historic rivalry with Leeds United. In terms of club value, Chelsea is the ninth-most-valuable football club in the world (as of 2024), worth $3.13 billion, and is the ninth-highest-earning football club in the world.[7][8]\\n\\nHistory\\nFounding and early years (1905–1952)\\nMain article: History of Chelsea F.C. (1905–1952)\\n\\nThe first Chelsea team, September 1905\\nIn 1904, Gus Mears acquired the Stamford Bridge athletics stadium in Fulham with the aim of turning it into a football ground. An offer to lease it to nearby Fulham F.C. was turned down, so Mears opted to found his own club to use the stadium. As there was already a team named Fulham in the borough, the name of the adjacent borough of Chelsea was chosen for the new club; names like Kensington FC, Stamford Bridge FC and London FC were considered.[9] Chelsea F.C. was founded on 10 March 1905 at The Rising Sun pub (now The Butcher\\'s Hook),[1][10] opposite the present-day main entrance to the ground on Fulham Road, and were elected to the Football League shortly afterwards.\\n\\nChelsea won promotion to the First Division in their second season, and yo-yoed between the First and Second Divisions in its early years. The team reached the 1915 FA Cup final, where they lost to Sheffield United at Old Trafford, and finished third in the First Division in 1920, the club\\'s best league campaign to that point.[11] Chelsea had a reputation for signing star players[12] and attracted large crowds. The club had the highest average attendance in English football in ten separate seasons[13] including 1907–08,[14] 1909–10,[15] 1911–12,[16] 1912–13,[17] 1913–14[18] and 1919–20.[19][20] They were FA Cup semi-finalists in 1920 and 1932 and remained in the First Division throughout the 1930s, but success eluded the club in the inter-war years.\\n\\nModernisation and the first league championship (1952–1983)\\nMain article: History of Chelsea F.C. (1952–1983)\\n\\nChart showing the progress of Chelsea\\'s league finishes from 1906 to the present\\nFormer Arsenal and England centre-forward Ted Drake was appointed manager in 1952 and proceeded to modernise the club. He removed the club\\'s Chelsea pensioner crest, improved the youth set-up and training regime, rebuilt the side with shrewd signings from the lower divisions and amateur leagues, and led Chelsea to their first major trophy success – the League championship – in 1954–55. The following season saw UEFA create the European Champions\\' Cup, but after objections from The Football League, Chelsea were persuaded to withdraw from the competition before it started.[21][22] Chelsea failed to build on this success, and spent the remainder of the 1950s in mid-table. Drake was dismissed in 1961 and replaced by player-coach Tommy Docherty.\\n\\nDocherty built a new team around the group of talented young players emerging from the club\\'s youth set-up, and Chelsea challenged for honours throughout the 1960s, enduring several near-misses. They were on course for a treble of League, FA Cup and League Cup going into the final stages of the 1964–65 season, winning the League Cup but faltering late on in the other two.[23] In three seasons the side were beaten in three major semi-finals and were FA Cup runners-up. Under Docherty\\'s successor, Dave Sexton, Chelsea won the FA Cup in 1970, beating Leeds United 2–1 in a final replay. The following year, Chelsea took their first European honour, a UEFA Cup Winners\\' Cup triumph, with another replayed win, this time over Real Madrid in Athens.\\n\\nRedevelopment and financial crisis (1983–2003)\\nMain article: History of Chelsea F.C. (1983–2003)\\nThe late 1970s through to the \\'80s was a turbulent period for Chelsea. An ambitious redevelopment of Stamford Bridge threatened the financial stability of the club,[24] star players were sold and the team were relegated. Further problems were caused by a notorious hooligan element among the support, which was to plague the club throughout the decade.[25] In 1982, at the nadir of their fortunes, Chelsea were acquired by Ken Bates from Mears\\' great-nephew Brian Mears, for the nominal sum of £1. Bates bought a controlling stake in the club and floated Chelsea on the AIM stock exchange in March 1996[26] although by now the Stamford Bridge freehold had been sold to property developers, meaning the club faced losing their home.[27] On the pitch, the team had fared little better, coming close to relegation to the Third Division for the first time, but in 1983 manager John Neal put together an impressive new team for minimal outlay. Chelsea won the Second Division title in 1983–84 and established themselves in the top division with two top-six finishes, before being relegated again in 1988. The club bounced back immediately by winning the Second Division championship in 1988–89.\\n\\nAfter a long-running legal battle, Bates reunited the stadium freehold with the club in 1992 by doing a deal with the banks of the property developers, who had been bankrupted by a market crash.[28] In the mid-1990s Chelsea fan and businessman Matthew Harding became a director and loaned the club £26 million to build the new North Stand and invest in new players.[29] Chelsea\\'s form in the new Premier League was unconvincing, although they did reach the 1994 FA Cup final. The appointment of Ruud Gullit as player-manager in 1996 began an upturn in the team\\'s fortunes. He added several top international players to the side and led the club to their first major honour since 1971, the FA Cup. Gullit was replaced by Gianluca Vialli, whose reign saw Chelsea win the League Cup, the UEFA Cup Winners\\' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup in 1998, and the FA Cup in 2000. They mounted a strong title challenge in 1998–99, finishing four points behind champions Manchester United, and made their first appearance in the UEFA Champions League. Vialli was sacked in favour of Claudio Ranieri, who guided Chelsea to the 2002 FA Cup final and Champions League qualification in 2002–03.\\n\\nAbramovich ownership (2003–2022)\\nMain article: History of Chelsea F.C. (2003–2022)\\n\\nAbramovich at Stamford Bridge during a 4–0 victory over Portsmouth, August 2008\\nWith the club facing an apparent financial crisis,[30] Bates unexpectedly sold Chelsea F.C. in June 2003 for £60 million.[31] In so doing, he reportedly recognised a personal profit of £17 million on the club he had bought for £1 in 1982 (his stake had been diluted to just below 30% over the years). The club\\'s new owner was Russian oligarch and billionaire Roman Abramovich, who took on responsibility for the club\\'s £80 million of debt, quickly paying some of it. Sergei Pugachev alleged Chelsea was bought on Putin\\'s orders, an allegation Abramovich has denied.[32] Bates mentioned that Abramovich was in talks to buy Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur before he bought Chelsea in a deal sealed in a day.[33]\\n\\n\\nChelsea players celebrate their first UEFA Champions League title against Bayern Munich (2012).\\nOver £100 million was spent on new players, but Ranieri was unable to deliver any trophies,[34] and was replaced by José Mourinho.[35] Under Mourinho, Chelsea became the fifth English team to win back-to-back league championships since the Second World War (2004–05 and 2005–06),[36] in addition to winning an FA Cup (2007) and two League Cups (2005 and 2007). After a poor start to the 2007–08 season, Mourinho was replaced by Avram Grant,[37] who led the club to their first UEFA Champions League final, which they lost on penalties to Manchester United. The club did not turn a profit in the first nine years of Abramovich\\'s ownership, and made record losses of £140m in June 2005.[38]\\n\\nI am a fan of special nature. I\\'m excited before every single game. The trophy at the end is less important than the process itself.\\n\\n—Abramovich discussing two trophy-laden years at Chelsea (2006).[39]\\nIn 2009, under caretaker manager Guus Hiddink, Chelsea won another FA Cup.[40] In 2009–10, his successor Carlo Ancelotti led them to their first Premier League and FA Cup Double, becoming the first English top-flight club to score 100 league goals in a season since 1963.[41] In 2012, Roberto Di Matteo led Chelsea to their seventh FA Cup,[42] and their first UEFA Champions League title, beating Bayern Munich 4–3 on penalties, the first London club to win the trophy.[43] The following year the club won the UEFA Europa League,[44] making them the first club to hold two major European titles simultaneously and one of five clubs to have won the three main UEFA trophies.[45] Mourinho returned as manager in 2013 and led Chelsea to League Cup success in March 2015,[46] and the Premier League title two months later.[47] Mourinho was sacked after four months of the following season after a poor start.[48]\\n\\nIn November 2012, Chelsea announced a profit of £1.4 million for the year ending 30 June 2012, the first time the club had made a profit under Abramovich\\'s ownership.[38][49] This was followed by a loss in 2013 and then their highest ever profit of £18.4 million for the year to June 2014.[50] In 2018 Chelsea announced a record after-tax profit of £62 million.[51]\\n\\nIn 2017, under new coach Antonio Conte, Chelsea won their sixth English title and the following season won their eighth FA Cup.[52] In 2018 Conte was sacked after a fifth-place finish and replaced with Maurizio Sarri,[53][54] under whom Chelsea reached the League Cup final, which they lost on penalties to Manchester City[55] and won the Europa League for a second time, beating Arsenal 4–1 in the final. Sarri then left the club to become manager of Juventus and was replaced by former Chelsea player Frank Lampard.[56]\\n\\nIn Lampard\\'s first season, he guided Chelsea to fourth place in the Premier League and reached the FA Cup final, losing 2–1 to Arsenal.[57] Lampard was dismissed in January 2021 and replaced with Thomas Tuchel.[58][59]\\n\\n\\nPlayers of Chelsea celebrating their first FIFA Club World Cup title (2021) after beating Brazilian side Palmeiras in the final\\nUnder Tuchel, Chelsea reached the FA Cup final, losing 1–0 to Leicester City, and won their second UEFA Champions League title with a 1–0 win over Manchester City in Porto.[60] The club subsequently won the 2021 UEFA Super Cup for the second time by defeating Villarreal 6–5 in a penalty shootout, after it had ended 1–1 in Belfast after extra time,[61] and the 2021 FIFA Club World Cup (the first for the club) in Abu Dhabi after beating Brazilian Palmeiras 2–1.[62]\\n\\nOn 18 April 2021, Chelsea announced it would be joining a new European Super League, a league competition comprising the biggest European clubs.[63] After a backlash from supporters, the club announced their withdrawal days later.[64] The club opted against furloughing their non-matchday staff during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the decision reportedly coming from Abramovich himself. Chelsea, one of the first clubs to help the National Health Service, lent the club-owned Millennium Hotel for the NHS staff.[65]\\n\\n\"[Chelsea] have been a success machine for the last 10–20 years. That doesn\\'t just come with money, we\\'ve seen at Manchester United and Arsenal where they\\'ve put billions into the team and not had the success that Chelsea have had.

Our vision as owners is clear: we want to make the fans proud.\\n\\n—Todd Boehly, addressing the press after the takeover.[77]\\nOn 7 May 2022, Chelsea confirmed that terms had been agreed for a new ownership group, led by Todd Boehly, Clearlake Capital, Mark Walter and Hansjörg Wyss, to acquire the club. The group was later known as BlueCo.[78] The UK government approved the £4.25bn takeover,[79] ending Abramovich\\'s 19-year ownership of the club.[80] Bruce Buck, who served as chairman since 2003, was replaced by Boehly,[81] while long-serving club director and de facto sporting director Marina Granovskaia left,[82] as did Petr Čech from the role of technical and performance advisor.[83]\\n\\nThe club brought in Graham Potter from Brighton & Hove Albion to replace Tuchel on 8 September 2022. Chelsea won six of the first 11 games of the 2022–23 season, but only five of the remaining 27. Potter would be sacked on 2 April 2023 and eventually be replaced by Frank Lampard as caretaker manager.[84] Under Lampard the club would only win one of their last 11 matches resulting in a 9% win percentage. Lampard\\'s win percentage was the worst for any Chelsea manager who managed three games or more.[85] Chelsea scored a record-low 38 goals across the entire season and finished in the bottom half of the table for the first time since 1995–96.[86]\\n\\nMauricio Pochettino was announced as Lampard\\'s replacement in 2023.[87] He led Chelsea to a 6th-place finish, and a place in the Conference League play-off round qualification. He also led Chelsea to the 2024 EFL Cup final, narrowly losing 0–1 to Liverpool.[88] After clashing with the sporting directors Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley over strategy and management of the young squad,[89][90][91][92] Pochettino agreed to leave the club at the end of the season.[93][94]\\n\\nOn 3 June 2024, Enzo Maresca was announced as Pochettino\\'s replacement, with the Italian beginning his term as manager on 1 July 2024.[95]\\n\\nLeague history\\n1905–1907 Division 2 (L2)\\n1907–1910 Division 1 (L1)\\n1910–1912 Division 2 (L2)\\n1912–1924 Division 1 (L1)\\n1924–1930 Division 2 (L2)\\n1930–1962 Division 1 (L1)\\n1962–1963 Division 2 (L2)\\n1963–1975 Division 1 (L1)\\n1975–1977 Division 2 (L2)\\n1977–1979 Division 1 (L1)\\n1979–1984 Division 2 (L2)\\n1984–1988 Division 1 (L1)\\n1988–1989 Division 2 (L2)\\n1989–1992 Division 1 (L1)\\n1992–present Premier League (L1)\\nL1 = Level 1 of the football league system; L2 = Level 2 of the football league system\\nStadium\\nMain article: Stamford Bridge (stadium)\\n\\nStamford Bridge, West Stand\\nChelsea have only had one home ground, Stamford Bridge, where they have played since the team\\'s foundation. The stadium was officially opened on 28 April 1877 and for the next 28 years it was used by the London Athletic Club as an arena for athletics meetings. In 1904, the ground was acquired by businessman Gus Mears and his brother Joseph, who had purchased nearby land (formerly a large market garden) with the aim of staging football matches on the now 12.5 acre (51,000 m2) site.[96] Stamford Bridge was designed for the Mears family by the noted football architect Archibald Leitch, who had designed Ibrox, Craven Cottage and Hampden Park.[97] Most football clubs were founded first, and then sought grounds in which to play, but Chelsea were founded for Stamford Bridge.\\n\\nStarting with an open bowl-like design and one grandstand with seating, Stamford Bridge had an original capacity of around 100,000, making it the second biggest stadium in England after Crystal Palace.[96] The early 1930s saw the construction of a terrace on the southern part of the ground with a roof that covered around 20% of the stand. As the roof resembled that of a corrugated iron shed, the stand eventually became known as the \"Shed End\", although it is unknown who first coined this name. From the 1960s, it became known as the home of Chelsea\\'s most loyal and vocal supporters.[96] In 1939, another small seated stand was added, the North Stand, which remained until its demolition in 1975.[96]\\n\\nIn the early 1970s, the club\\'s owners announced a modernisation of Stamford Bridge with plans for a state-of-the-art 50,000 all-seater stadium.[96] Work began in 1972 but the project was beset with problems and ultimately only the East Stand was completed; the cost brought the club close to bankruptcy. The freehold was sold to property developers and the club were under threat of eviction from the stadium.[96] Following a long legal battle, it was not until the mid-1990s that Chelsea\\'s future at Stamford Bridge was secured and renovation work resumed.[96] The north, west and southern parts of the ground were converted into all-seater stands and moved closer to the pitch, a process completed by 2001. The East Stand was retained from the 1970s development. In 1996, the north stand was renamed the Matthew Harding stand, after the club director and benefactor who was killed in a helicopter crash earlier that year.[98]\\n\\n\\nChelsea vs. West Bromwich Albion at Stamford Bridge on 23 September 1905; Chelsea won 1–0.\\nWhen Stamford Bridge was redeveloped in the Bates era many additional features were added to the complex including two Millennium & Copthorne hotels, apartments, bars, restaurants, the Chelsea Megastore, and an interactive visitor attraction called Chelsea World of Sport. The intention was that these facilities would provide extra revenue to support the football side of the business, but they were less successful than hoped and before the Abramovich takeover in 2003 the debt taken on to finance them was a major burden on the club. Soon after the takeover a decision was taken to drop the \"Chelsea Village\" brand and refocus on Chelsea as a football club. However, the stadium is sometimes still referred to as part of \"Chelsea Village\" or \"The Village\".\\n\\nThe Stamford Bridge freehold, the pitch, the turnstiles and Chelsea\\'s naming rights are now owned by Chelsea Pitch Owners, a non-profit organisation in which fans are the shareholders. The CPO was created to ensure the stadium could never again be sold to developers. As a condition for using the Chelsea FC name, the club has to play its first team matches at Stamford Bridge, which means that if the club moves to a new stadium, they may have to change their name.[99] Chelsea\\'s training ground is located in Cobham, Surrey. Chelsea moved to Cobham in 2004. Their previous training ground in Harlington was taken over by QPR in 2005.[100] The new training facilities in Cobham were completed in 2007.[101]\\n\\n\\nAerial view of present-day Stamford Bridge\\nStamford Bridge hosted the FA Cup final from 1920 to 1922,[102] has held 10 FA Cup Semi-finals (most recently in 1978), ten FA Charity Shield matches (the last in 1970), and three England international matches, the last in 1932; it was the venue for an unofficial Victory International in 1946.[103] The 2013 UEFA Women\\'s Champions League final was played at Stamford Bridge as well.[104] The stadium has been used for a variety of other sports. In October 1905 it hosted a rugby union match between the All Blacks and Middlesex,[105] and in 1914 hosted a baseball match between the touring New York Giants and the Chicago White Sox.[106] It was the venue for a boxing match between world flyweight champion Jimmy Wilde and Joe Conn in 1918.[107] The running track was used for dirt track racing between 1928 and 1932,[108] greyhound racing from 1933 to 1968, and Midget car racing in 1948.[109] In 1980, Stamford Bridge hosted the first international floodlit cricket match in the UK, between Essex and the West Indies.[110] It was the home stadium of the London Monarchs American Football team for the 1997 season.[111]\\n\\nThe previous owner Abramovich and the club\\'s then executive board determined that a larger stadium is necessary in order for Chelsea to stay competitive with rival clubs who have significantly larger stadia, such as Arsenal and Manchester United.[112] Owing to its location next to a main road and two railway lines, fans can only enter Stamford Bridge via the Fulham Road, which places constraints on expansion due to health and safety regulations.[113] The club have consistently affirmed their desire to keep Chelsea at their current home,[114][115] but have nonetheless been linked with a move to various nearby sites, including the Earls Court Exhibition Centre, Battersea Power Station and the Chelsea Barracks.[116] In October 2011, a proposal from the club to buy back the freehold to the land on which Stamford Bridge sits was voted down by Chelsea Pitch Owners shareholders.[117] In May 2012, the club made a formal bid to purchase Battersea Power Station, with a view to developing the site into a new stadium,[118] but lost out to a Malaysian consortium.[119] The club subsequently announced plans to redevelop Stamford Bridge into a 60,000-seater stadium,[120] and in January 2017 these plans were approved by Hammersmith and Fulham council.[121] However, on 31 May 2018, the club released a statement saying that the new stadium project had been put on hold indefinitely, citing \"the current unfavourable investment climate\".[122]\\n\\nIn July 2022, it was reported that the club\\'s new owner Todd Boehly had appointed American architect Janet Marie Smith to oversee the renovation of the stadium.[123]\\n\\nIdentity\\nCrest\\nChelsea has had four main crests, which all underwent minor variations. The first, adopted when the club was founded, was the image of a Chelsea Pensioner, the army veterans who reside at the nearby Royal Hospital Chelsea. This contributed to the club\\'s original \"pensioner\" nickname, and remained for the next half-century, though it never appeared on the shirts. When Ted Drake became Chelsea manager in 1952, he began to modernise the club. Believing the Chelsea pensioner crest to be old-fashioned, he insisted that it be replaced.[124] A stop-gap badge which comprised the initials C.F.C. was adopted for a year. In 1953, the club crest was changed to an upright blue lion looking backwards and holding a staff. It was based on elements in the coat of arms of the Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea[125] with the \"lion rampant regardant\" taken from the arms of then club president Viscount Chelsea and the staff from the Abbots of Westminster, former Lords of the Manor of Chelsea. It featured three red roses, to represent England, and two footballs.[124] This was the first Chelsea crest to appear on the shirts, in the early 1960s. In 1975, a heraldic badge was granted by the College of Arms to the English Football League for use by Chelsea. The badge took the form of the familiar lion and staff encircled by a blue ring but without lettering and without the red roses and red footballs (blazoned as \"A lion rampant reguardant azure supporting with the forepaws a crozier or all within an annulet azure\").[126] In 1986, with Ken Bates owner of the club, Chelsea\\'s crest was changed again as part of another attempt to modernise and because the old rampant lion badge could not be trademarked.[127] The new badge featured a more naturalistic non-heraldic lion, in white and not blue, standing over the C.F.C. initials. This lasted for the next 19 years, with some modifications such as the use of different colours, including red from 1987 to 1995, and yellow from 1995 until 1999, before the white returned.[128] With the new ownership of Roman Abramovich, and the club\\'s centenary approaching, combined with demands from fans for the popular 1950s badge to be restored, it was decided that the crest should be changed again in 2005. The new crest was officially adopted for the start of the 2005–06 season and marked a return to the older design, used from 1953 to 1986, featuring a blue heraldic lion holding a staff. For the centenary season this was accompanied by the words \\'100 Years\\' and \\'Centenary 2005–2006\\' on the top and bottom of the crest respectively.[129]\\n\\nColours\\n\\nChelsea\\'s first home colours (1905 – c.\\u20091912)[130]\\n\\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Chelsea F.C. kits.\\nChelsea have always worn blue shirts, although they originally used the paler eton blue, which was taken from the racing colours of then club president, Earl Cadogan, and was worn with white shorts and dark blue or black socks.[131] The light blue shirts were replaced by a royal blue version in around 1912.[132] In the 1960s Chelsea manager Tommy Docherty changed the kit again, switching to blue shorts (which have remained ever since) and white socks, believing it made the club\\'s colours more modern and distinctive, since no other major side used that combination; this kit was first worn during the 1964–65 season.[133] Since then Chelsea have always worn white socks with their home kit apart from a short spell from 1985 to 1992, when blue socks were reintroduced.\\n\\nChelsea\\'s away colours are usually all yellow or all white with blue trim. More recently, the club have had a number of black or dark blue away kits which alternate every year.[134] As with most teams, they have had some more unusual ones. At Docherty\\'s behest, in the 1966 FA Cup semi-final they wore blue and black stripes, based on Inter Milan\\'s kit.[135] In the mid-1970s, the away strip was a red, white and green kit inspired by the Hungarian national side of the 1950s.[136] Other away kits include an all jade strip worn from 1986 to 1989, red and white diamonds from 1990 to 1992, graphite and tangerine from 1994 to 1996, and luminous yellow from 2007 to 2008.[134] The graphite and tangerine strip has appeared in lists of the worst football kits ever.[137]\\n\\nSongs and fan chants\\nThe song \"Blue is the Colour\" was released as a single in the build-up to the 1972 League Cup final, with all members of Chelsea\\'s first team squad singing; it reached number five in the UK Singles Chart.[138] The song has since been adopted by a number of other sports teams around the world, including the Vancouver Whitecaps (as \"White is the Colour\")[139] and the Saskatchewan Roughriders (as \"Green is the Colour\").[140]\\n\\nChelsea released the song \"No One Can Stop Us Now\" in 1994 for reaching the 1994 FA Cup final. It reached number 23 in the UK Singles Chart.[141] In the build-up to the 1997 FA Cup final, the song \"Blue Day\", performed by Suggs and members of the Chelsea squad, reached number 22 in the UK chart.[142] In 2000, Chelsea released the song \"Blue Tomorrow\". It reached number 22 in the UK Singles Chart.[141]\\n\\nAt matches, Chelsea fans sing chants such as \"Carefree\" (to the tune of \"Lord of the Dance\", whose lyrics were probably written by supporter Mick Greenaway),[143][144] \"Ten Men Went to Mow\", \"We All Follow the Chelsea\" (to the tune of \"Land of Hope and Glory\"), \"Zigga Zagga\", and the celebratory \"Celery\". The latter is often accompanied by fans throwing celery at each other, although the vegetable was banned inside Stamford Bridge after an incident involving midfielder Cesc Fàbregas at the 2007 League Cup final.[145] Popular fan chants include, \"Super Chelsea\", \"Super Frank\" (dedicated to all-time leading goal scorer Frank Lampard), \"We love you Chelsea\" and \"Come on Chelsea\". There are situation-specific or team-specific chants meant to rile up opposition teams, managers or players.[146]\\n\\nSupport\\n\\nChelsea fans at a match against Tottenham Hotspur, on 11 March 2006\\nChelsea is among the most widely supported football clubs in the world.[147][148] It has the sixth-highest average attendance in the history of English football,[149] and regularly attract over 40,000 fans to Stamford Bridge; they were the ninth best-supported Premier League team in the 2023–24 season, with an average gate of 39,700.[150] Chelsea\\'s traditional fanbase comes from all over the Greater London area including working-class parts such as Hammersmith and Battersea, wealthier areas like Chelsea and Kensington, and from the home counties. There are numerous official supporters clubs in the United Kingdom and all over the world.[151] Between 2007 and 2012, Chelsea were ranked fourth worldwide in annual replica kit sales, with an average of 910,000.[152] As of 2023, Chelsea has 118.9 million followers on social media, the fourth highest among football clubs.[153]\\n\\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s in particular, Chelsea supporters were associated with football hooliganism. The club\\'s \"football firm\", originally known as the Chelsea Shed Boys, and subsequently as the Chelsea Headhunters, were nationally notorious for football violence, alongside hooligan firms from other clubs such as West Ham United\\'s Inter City Firm and Millwall\\'s Bushwackers, before, during and after matches.[154] The increase of hooligan incidents in the 1980s led chairman Ken Bates to propose erecting an electric fence to deter them from invading the pitch, a proposal that the Greater London Council rejected.[155]\\n\\nSince the 1990s, there has been a marked decline in crowd trouble at matches, as a result of stricter policing, CCTV in grounds and the advent of all-seater stadia.[156] In 2007, the club launched the Back to the Shed campaign to improve the atmosphere at home matches, with notable success. According to Home Office statistics, 126 Chelsea fans were arrested for football-related offences during the 2009–10 season, the third highest in the division, and 27 banning orders were issued, the fifth-highest in the division.[157]\\n\\nRivalries\\nMain articles: Arsenal F.C.–Chelsea F.C. rivalry, Chelsea F.C.–Liverpool F.C. rivalry, Chelsea F.C.–Tottenham Hotspur F.C. rivalry, West London derbies, and Chelsea F.C.–Leeds United F.C. rivalry\\nChelsea have long-standing rivalries with North London clubs Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur.[158][159] A strong rivalry with Leeds United dates back to several heated and controversial matches in the 1960s and 1970s, particularly the 1970 FA Cup final.[160] More recently a rivalry with Liverpool has grown following repeated clashes in cup competitions.[161][162] Fellow West London clubs Brentford, Fulham and Queens Park Rangers are considered rivals, but less so in recent times as matches have only taken place intermittently due to the teams often being in separate divisions.[163]\\n\\nA 2004 survey by Planetfootball.com found that Chelsea fans consider their main rivalries to be with (in descending order): Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United. In the same survey, fans of Arsenal, Fulham, Leeds United, QPR, Tottenham, and West Ham United named Chelsea as one of their three main rivals.[164] A 2012 survey, conducted among 1,200 supporters of the top four league divisions across the country, found that many clubs\\' main rivals had changed since 2003 and reported that Chelsea fans consider Tottenham to be their main rivals, above Arsenal and Manchester United. Additionally, fans of Arsenal, Brentford, Fulham, Liverpool, Manchester United, QPR, Tottenham and West Ham identified Chelsea as one of their top three rivals.[165]\\n\\nRecords and statistics\\nFurther information: List of Chelsea F.C. records and statistics\\n\\nFrank Lampard is Chelsea\\'s all-time highest goalscorer.\\nChelsea\\'s highest appearance-maker is ex-captain Ron Harris, who played in 795 competitive games for the club between 1961 and 1980.[166] Five other players made more than 500 appearances for the club: Peter Bonetti (729; 1959–79), John Terry (717; 1998–2017), Frank Lampard (648; 2001–2014), John Hollins (592; 1963–1975 and 1983–1984), and César Azpilicueta (508; 2012–2023).[167] With 103 caps (101 while at the club) for England, Lampard is Chelsea\\'s most capped international player. Every starting player in Chelsea\\'s 57 games of the 2013–14 season was a full international – a new club record.[168]\\n\\nLampard is Chelsea\\'s all-time top goalscorer, having scored 211 goals in 648 games (2001–2014);[166] he passed Bobby Tambling\\'s longstanding record of 202 in May 2013.[169] Eight other players have scored over 100 goals for Chelsea: George Hilsdon (1906–1912), George Mills (1929–1939), Roy Bentley (1948–1956), Jimmy Greaves (1957–1961), Peter Osgood (1964–1974 and 1978–1979), Kerry Dixon (1983–1992), Didier Drogba (2004–2012 and 2014–2015), and Eden Hazard (2012–2019). Greaves holds the club record for the most goals scored in one season (43 in 1960–61).[170] While a Chelsea player, Greaves became the youngest ever player to score 100 goals in the English top-flight, at 20 years and 290 days.[171]\\n\\nChelsea\\'s biggest winning scoreline in a competitive match is 13–0, achieved against Jeunesse Hautcharage in the Cup Winners\\' Cup in 1971.[172] The club\\'s biggest top-flight win was an 8–0 victory against Wigan Athletic in 2010, which was matched in 2012 against Aston Villa.[173] Chelsea\\'s biggest loss was an 8–1 reverse against Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1953.[174][175] The club\\'s 21–0 aggregate victory over Jeunesse Hautcharage in the UEFA Cup Winners\\' Cup in 1971 is a record in European competition.[176] Officially, Chelsea\\'s highest home attendance is 82,905 for a First Division match against Arsenal on 12 October 1935. However, an estimated crowd of over 100,000 attended a friendly match against Soviet team Dynamo Moscow on 13 November 1945.[177][178]\\n\\n\\nIn January 2011 Chelsea broke the British transfer record to sign Fernando Torres for £50 million; the record stood until 2014\\nFrom 20 March 2004 to 26 October 2008, Chelsea went a record 86 consecutive league matches at home without defeat, beating the previous record of 63 matches unbeaten set by Liverpool between 1978 and 1980.[179][180] Chelsea hold the English record for the fewest goals conceded during a league season (15), the highest number of clean sheets overall in a Premier League season (25) (both set during the 2004–05 season),[181] and the most consecutive clean sheets from the start of a league season (6, set during the 2005–06 season).[182] Chelsea is the only Premier League side to have won its opening nine league games of the season, doing so in 2005–06.[183][184] From 2009 to 2013, Chelsea were unbeaten in a record 29 consecutive FA Cup matches (excluding penalty shoot-outs).[185]\\n\\nOn 25 August 1928, Chelsea, along with Arsenal, became the first club to play with shirt numbers, in their match against Swansea Town.[186] They were the first English side to travel by aeroplane to a domestic away match, when they visited Newcastle United on 19 April 1957,[187] and the first First Division side to play a match on a Sunday, when they faced Stoke City on 27 January 1974. On 26 December 1999, Chelsea became the first British side to field an entirely foreign starting line-up (no British or Irish players) in a Premier League match against Southampton.[188] In May 2007, Chelsea were the first team to win the FA Cup at the new Wembley Stadium, having been the last to win it at the old Wembley.[189] They were the first English club to be ranked No. 1 under UEFA\\'s five-year coefficient system in the 21st century.[190] They were the first Premier League team, and the first team in the English top flight since 1962–63, to score at least 100 goals in a single season, reaching the milestone during the 2009–10 season.[41] Chelsea is the only London club to have won the UEFA Champions League.[191][192] Upon winning the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League, Chelsea became the first English club to win all four UEFA club trophies and the only club to hold the Champions League and the Europa League at the same time.[193]\\n\\nChelsea have broken the record for the highest transfer fee paid by a British club three times. Their £30.8 million purchase of Andriy Shevchenko from A.C. Milan in June 2006 was a British record until surpassed by the £32.5 million paid by Manchester City for Robinho in September 2008.[194][195] The club\\'s £50 million purchase of Fernando Torres from Liverpool in January 2011[196] held the record until Ángel Di María signed for Manchester United in August 2014 for £59.7 million.[197] The club\\'s £71 million purchase of Kepa Arrizabalaga in August 2018 remains a world record fee paid for a goalkeeper.[198]\\n\\nOn 12 February 2022, Chelsea became the first London club to win the FIFA Club World Cup. In the final it beat Palmeiras with Kai Havertz scoring a late penalty.[199] Chelsea broke the spending record in the winter transfer window with a £289 million spending spree on eight new signings, with the £107 million signing of Enzo Fernandez breaking the British transfer record.[200]\\n\\nOwnership and finances\\n\\nTodd Boehly, chairman and one of the co-owners of Chelsea\\nChelsea Football Club was founded by Gus Mears in 1905. After his death in 1912, his descendants continued to own the club until 1982, when Ken Bates bought the club from Mears\\' great-nephew Brian Mears for £1. Bates bought a controlling stake in the club and floated Chelsea on the AIM stock exchange in March 1996.[26] In the mid-1990s Chelsea fan and businessman Matthew Harding became a director, and loaned the club £26 million to build the new North Stand and invest in new players.[29]\\n\\nIn July 2003, Roman Abramovich purchased just over 50% of Chelsea Village plc\\'s share capital, including Bates\\' 29.5% stake, for £30 million and over the following weeks bought out most of the remaining 12,000 shareholders at 35 pence per share, completing a £140 million takeover. Other shareholders at the time of the takeover included the Matthew Harding estate (21%), BSkyB (9.9%) and various anonymous offshore trusts.[201]\\n\\nAt the time of the Abramovich takeover, the club had debts of around £100 million, which included a 10-year £75 million Eurobond taken out in 1997 by the Bates regime to buy the freehold of Stamford Bridge and finance the redevelopment of the stadium. The 9% interest on the loan cost the club around £7 million a year and according to Bruce Buck, Chelsea were struggling to pay an instalment due in July 2003.[202] Abramovich paid off some of that debt immediately, but the outstanding £36 million on the Eurobond was not fully repaid until 2008.[203] Since then, the club had no external debt.[204]\\n\\nAbramovich changed the ownership name to Chelsea FC plc, whose ultimate parent company was Fordstam Limited, which was controlled by him.[205] Chelsea were additionally funded by Abramovich via interest free soft loans channelled through his holding company Fordstam Limited. The loans stood at £709 million in December 2009, when they were all converted to equity by Abramovich, leaving the club themselves debt free,[206][207] although the debt remained with Fordstam.[208]\\n\\nChelsea did not turn a profit in the first nine years of Abramovich\\'s ownership, and made record losses of £140m in June 2005.[38] In November 2012, Chelsea announced a profit of £1.4 million for the year ending 30 June 2012, the first time the club had made a profit under Abramovich\\'s ownership.[38][49] This was followed by a loss in 2013 and then their highest ever profit of £18.4 million for the year to June 2014.[50] In 2018 Chelsea announced a record after-tax profit of £62 million.[51]\\n\\nChelsea has been described as a global brand; a 2012 report by Brand Finance ranked Chelsea fifth among football brands and valued the club\\'s brand value at US$398 million – an increase of 27% from the previous year, valuing it at US$10 million more than the sixth best brand, London rivals Arsenal – and gave the brand a strength rating of AA (very strong).[209][210] In 2016, Forbes magazine ranked Chelsea the seventh most valuable football club in the world, at £1.15 billion ($1.66 billion).[211] As of 2016, Chelsea was ranked eighth in the Deloitte Football Money League with an annual commercial revenue of £322.59 million.[212]\\n\\nAs of May 2022, Chelsea was ranked the eighth-most valuable club in the world according to Forbes,[213] and eighth according to Deloitte, with an annual commercial revenue of €493.1 million.[214]\\n\\nThe club\\'s recent accounting records highlight £26.6m they lost in compensation to former head coach Antonio Conte for sacking and to pay off his backroom staff and the legal costs that followed.[215]\\n\\nOn 26 February 2022, during the Russo-Ukrainian War, Abramovich handed over \"stewardship and care\" of Chelsea FC to the Chelsea Charitable Foundation.[216] Abramovich released an official statement on 2 March 2022 confirming that he was selling the club due to the ongoing situation in Ukraine.[217] Although the UK government froze Abramovich\\'s assets in United Kingdom on 10 March due to his \"close ties with Kremlin\", it was made clear that the Chelsea club will be allowed to operate in terms of activities which are football related.[218] On 12 March, the Premier League disqualified Abramovich as a director of Chelsea Football Club.[219]\\n\\nOn 19 March 2022, there were five confirmed bids to acquire Chelsea FC: submitted to Raine Capital which was handling the sale of the club. Some of these were a consortium led by ex-Liverpool chairman Sir Martin Broughton, a group of investors led by the Ricketts family (among them Joe and Pete Ricketts), Swiss and American businessmen Hansjörg Wyss and Todd Boehly, Aethel Partners headed by Portuguese Ricardo Santos Silva and British businessman Nick Candy, supported by former Chelsea striker Gianluca Vialli.[220]\\n\\nOn 7 May, the club finally confirmed that \"terms have been agreed\" for a new ownership group led by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital.[221] On 30 May, it was confirmed that the Boehly consortium had completed the purchase of the club.[222] The consortium includes Wyss and Mark Walter. Walter and Boehly are also owners of the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Los Angeles Lakers, and the Los Angeles Sparks. The consortium was later known as BlueCo. The transaction had received all necessary approvals from the governments of the United Kingdom and, the Premier League, and other authorities.[223][224]\\n\\nSponsorship\\nChelsea\\'s kit has been manufactured by Nike since July 2017.

       " 'AC Milan': 'Associazione Calcio Milan (Italian pronunciation: [assotʃatˈtsjoːne ˈkaltʃo ˈmiːlan]), commonly referred to as Milan or AC Milan (Italian pronunciation: [a tˌtʃi mˈmiːlan]) mainly outside of Italy,[6] is an Italian professional football club based in Milan, Lombardy. Founded in 1899, the club competes in the Serie A, the top tier of Italian football. In its early history, Milan played its home games in different grounds around the city before moving to its current stadium, the San Siro, in 1926.[7] The stadium, which was built by Milan\\'s second chairman, Piero Pirelli, and has been shared with Inter Milan since 1947,[8] is the largest in Italian football, with a total capacity of 75,817.[9] The club has a long-standing rivalry with Inter, with whom they contest the Derby della Madonnina, one of the most followed derbies in football.[10]\\n\\nMilan has spent its entire history in Serie A with the exception of the 1980–81 and 1982–83 seasons.[11][12] Silvio Berlusconi’s 31-year tenure as Milan president was a standout period in the club\\'s history, as they established themselves as one of Europe\\'s most dominant and successful clubs. Milan won 29 trophies during his tenure, securing multiple Serie A and UEFA Champions League titles. During the 1991–92 season, the club notably achieved the feat of being the first team to win the Serie A title without losing a single game.[13] Milan is home to multiple Ballon d\\'Or winners, and three of the club\\'s players, Marco van Basten, Ruud Gullit, and Frank Rijkaard, were ranked in the top three on the podium for the 1988 Ballon d\\'Or, an unprecedented achievement in the history of the prize.[14]\\n\\nMilan is one of the most successful football clubs in the world in terms of total trophies won. Domestically, Milan has won 19 league titles,[15] 5 Coppa Italia titles and 8 Supercoppa Italiana titles.[16] In international competitions, Milan is Italy\\'s most successful club.[nb 1][16][17][18][19] The club has won seven European Cup/Champions League titles, making them the competition\\'s second-most successful team behind Real Madrid, and further honours include five UEFA Super Cups, two UEFA Cup Winners\\' Cups, a joint record[nb 2] two Latin Cups, a joint record[nb 3] three Intercontinental Cups and one FIFA Club World Cup.[16]\\n\\nMilan is one of the wealthiest clubs in Italian and world football.[20] It was a founding member of the now-defunct G-14 group of Europe\\'s leading football clubs as well as its replacement, the European Club Association.[21]\\n\\nHistory\\nMain article: History of AC Milan\\nFoundation and early years (1899–1950)\\nA black-and-white picture of Herbert Kilpin, the first captain of AC Milan\\nHerbert Kilpin, the club\\'s first captain and one of its founding members\\n\\nThe AC Milan formation that won the Italian championship in 1901\\n\"Saremo una squadra di diavoli.

Our colours will be red like fire and black like the fear we will invoke in our opponents.\"\\n\\n—\\u200a1899, Herbert Kilpin\\nAC Milan was founded as Milan Foot-Ball and Cricket Club in 1899 by English expatriate Herbert Kilpin.[12] The club claims 16 December of that year as their foundation date,[24] but historical evidence seems to suggest that the club was actually founded a few days after, most likely on 18 December.[2] However, with the club\\'s charter being lost, the exact date remains open to debate.\\n\\nIn honour of its English origins, the club has retained the English spelling of the city\\'s name, as opposed to the Italian spelling Milano, which it was forced to bear under the fascist regime. Milan won its first Italian championship in 1901, interrupting a three-year hegemony of Genoa, and a further two in succession in 1906 and 1907.[11] The club proved successful in the first decade of its existence, with several important trophies won, including, among others, the Medaglia del Re three times,[25] the Palla Dapples 23 times[26] and the FGNI tournament five times, a competition organized by the Italian Gymnastics Federation but not officially recognized by the Italian Football Federation.[27]\\n\\nIn 1908, Milan experienced a split caused by internal disagreements over the signing of foreign players, which led to the forming of another Milan-based team, F.C. Internazionale.[28] Following these events, Milan did not manage to win a single domestic title until 1950–51,[16] with some exceptions represented by the 1915–16 Coppa Federale[29] and the 1917–18 Coppa Mauro,[30] two tournaments played during the First World War which, especially the former, received a lot of attention and proved to be highly competitive, despite them not being officially recognized by the Italian federation.\\n\\nReturn to victory and international affirmation (1950–1970)\\nThe 1950s saw the club return to the top of Italian football, headed by the famous Gre-No-Li Swedish trio Gunnar Gren, Gunnar Nordahl and Nils Liedholm. This was one of the club\\'s most successful periods domestically, with the Scudetto going to Milan in 1951, 1955, 1957 and 1959.[16] This decade witnessed also the first European successes of Milan, with the 1951 and 1956 Latin Cup triumphs against Lille and Athletic Bilbao. Milan was also the first Italian club to take part to the newly born European Cup in the 1955–56 season, and reached the final two years later, when they were defeated by Real Madrid.\\n\\n\\nAC Milan celebrating after winning the European Cup Winners\\' Cup final in 1968\\nThe 1960s began with the debut of Milan\\'s legend Gianni Rivera in 1960:[31] he would remain with the club for the rest of his career for the following 19 seasons. In 1961, Nereo Rocco was appointed as new coach of the club,[32] which under his leadership won immediately a scudetto in 1961–62, followed, in the next season, by Milan\\'s first European Cup triumph, achieved after beating Benfica in the final.[33][34] This success was repeated in 1969, with a 4–1 win over Ajax in the final, which was followed by the Intercontinental Cup title the same year.[16] During this period Milan also won its ninth scudetto, its first Coppa Italia, with victory over Padova in the 1967 final, and two European Cup Winners\\' Cups in 1967–68 and 1972–73, after defeating in the last match Hamburg and Leeds United respectively.[16]\\n\\n10th Scudetto and decline (1970–1986)\\n\\nFranco Baresi in 1979\\nDomestically, the 1970s were characterized by the pursuit of the 10th Serie A title, which grants the winner the Scudetto star. For three years in a row, in 1971, 1972 and 1973, Milan ended up second in the league, after some memorable duels with Inter and Juventus. Finally, the achievement was reached in 1979. The same year saw the retirement of Gianni Rivera and the debut of Franco Baresi, at his first full season with the club.\\n\\nAfter this success, the team went into a period of decline. The club in 1980 was involved in the Totonero scandal and as punishment was relegated to Serie B for the first time in its history.[35] The scandal was centred around a betting syndicate paying players and officials to fix the outcome of matches.[35] Milan achieved promotion back to Serie A at the first attempt, winning the 1980–81 Serie B title,[16] but were again relegated a year later as the team ended its 1981–82 campaign in third-last place. In 1983, Milan won the Serie B title for the second time in three seasons to return to Serie A,[16] where they achieved a sixth-place finish in 1983–84.\\n\\nBerlusconi\\'s ownership and international glory (1986–2012)\\nOn 20 February 1986, entrepreneur Silvio Berlusconi (who owned Fininvest and Mediaset) acquired the club and saved it from bankruptcy after investing vast amounts of money,[11] appointing rising manager Arrigo Sacchi at the helm of the Rossoneri and signing Dutch internationals Ruud Gullit, Marco van Basten and Frank Rijkaard.[11] The Dutch trio added an attacking impetus to the team, and complemented the club\\'s Italian internationals Paolo Maldini, Franco Baresi, Alessandro Costacurta and Roberto Donadoni. Under Sacchi, Milan won its first Scudetto in nine years in the 1987–88 season. The following year, the club won its first European Cup in two decades, beating Romanian club Steaua București 4–0 in the final. Milan retained their title with a 1–0 win over Benfica a year later and was the last team to win back-to-back European Cups until Real Madrid\\'s win in 2017.[36] The Milan team of 1988–1990, nicknamed the \"Immortals\" in the Italian media,[37] has been voted the best club side of all time in a global poll of experts conducted by World Soccer magazine.[38]\\n\\n\\nMauro Tassotti (left) holds the UEFA Champions League trophy along with manager Fabio Capello, following Milan\\'s victory in the 1993–94 edition of the tournament.\\nAfter Sacchi left Milan in 1991, he was replaced by the club\\'s former player Fabio Capello whose team won three consecutive Serie A titles between 1992 and 1994, a spell which included a 58-match unbeaten run in Serie A (which earned the team the label \"the Invincibles\"),[37][39][40] and back-to-back UEFA Champions League final appearances in 1993, 1994 and 1995. A year after losing 1–0 to Marseille in the 1993 Champions League final, Capello\\'s team reached its peak in one of Milan\\'s most memorable matches of all time, the famous 4–0 win over Barcelona in the 1994 Champions League final.[39] Capello\\'s side went on to win the 1995–96 league title before he left to manage Real Madrid in 1996.[39] In 1998–99, after a two-year period of decline, Milan lifted its 16th championship in the club\\'s centenary season.\\n\\n\\nMilan captain Paolo Maldini lifting the European Cup after they won the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League\\nMilan\\'s next period of success came under another former player, Carlo Ancelotti. After his appointment in November 2001, Ancelotti took Milan to the 2003 Champions League final, where they defeated Juventus on penalties to win the club\\'s sixth European Cup.[41] The team then won the Scudetto in 2003–04 before reaching the 2005 Champions League final, where they were beaten by Liverpool on penalties despite leading 3–0 at half-time.[41] Two years later, the two teams met again in the 2007 Champions League final, with Milan winning 2–1 to lift the title for a seventh time.[41][42] The team then won its first FIFA Club World Cup in December 2007.[43] In 2009, after becoming Milan\\'s second longest serving manager with 420 matches overseen,[43] Ancelotti left the club to take over as manager at Chelsea.\\n\\n\\nMilan celebrates winning the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League.\\nDuring this period, the club was involved in the Calciopoli scandal, where five teams were accused of fixing matches by selecting favourable referees.[44] A police inquiry excluded any involvement of Milan managers;[45] the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) unilaterally decided that it had sufficient evidence to charge Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani. As a result, Milan was initially punished with a 15-point deduction and was banned from the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League. An appeal saw that penalty reduced to eight points,[46] which allowed the club to retain its Champions League participation.\\n\\nFollowing the aftermath of Calciopoli, local rivals Internazionale dominated Serie A, winning four Scudetti. However, with the help a strong squad boasting players such as Zlatan Ibrahimović, Robinho and Alexandre Pato joining many of the veterans of the club\\'s mid-decade European successes, Milan recaptured the Scudetto in the 2010–11 Serie A season, their first since the 2003–04 season and 18th overall.[47][48]\\n\\nChanges in ownership and decline (2012–2019)\\n\\nJerseys of Paolo Maldini (number 3), Kaká (number 22) and Zlatan Ibrahimović (number 11) in the San Siro museum\\nAfter their 18th Scudetto, the club declined in performance. Milan failed to qualify to European competitions for a few years, and the only trophy won was the 2016 Supercoppa Italiana, achieved under Vincenzo Montella\\'s coaching after defeating Juventus in the penalty shoot-out.[citation needed]\\n\\nOn 5 August 2016, a new preliminary agreement was signed with the Chinese investment management company Sino-Europe Sports Investment Management Changxing Co., to which Fininvest sold a 99.93% stake of Milan for about €520 million, plus the refurbishment of the club financial debt of €220 million.[49] On 13 April 2017, the deal was completed and Rossoneri Sport Investment Lux became the new direct parent company of the club.[50] In order to finalise the deal, American hedge fund Elliott Management Corporation provided Li with a loan of €303 million (€180 million to complete the payment to Fininvest and €123 million issued directly to the club).[51][52] On 10 July 2018, Li failed to keep up with his loan repayment plan, neglecting to deposit a €32 million instalment on time in order to refinance the €303 million loan debt owed to the American hedge fund. As a result, In July 2018, chairman Li Yonghong\\'s investment vehicle Rossoneri Champion Inv. Lux. was removed as the shareholder of Rossoneri Sport Inv. Lux., the direct parent company of the club, making the investment vehicle majority controlled by Elliott Management Corporation the sole shareholder of Rossoneri Sport Inv. Lux.[53][54][55][56]\\n\\nOn 27 November 2017, Montella was sacked due to poor results and replaced by former player Gennaro Gattuso.[57] Milan qualified for the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League group stage after finishing 6th in the 2017–18 Serie A season, but were banned by UEFA from European competition due to violations of Financial Fair Play regulations for failure to break-even.[58] Milan appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport and the decision was overturned on 20 July 2018.[59][60][61]\\n\\nIn Gattuso\\'s first full season in charge, Milan exceeded expectations and spent much of the campaign in the top 4. Despite winning their final 4 games, Milan missed out on the Champions League by one point.[62] After Milan\\'s failure to qualify for the Champions League, Gattuso resigned as manager.[63] On 19 June 2019, Milan hired former Sampdoria manager Marco Giampaolo on a 2-year contract. On 28 June 2019, Milan was excluded from the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League for violating Financial Fair Play regulations for the years 2014–2017 and 2015–2018.[64]\\n\\nRecent history (2019–present)\\n\\nRossoneri fans celebrating their 2021–22 Serie A win in Piazza del Duomo, Milan\\nAfter four months in charge, Giampaolo was sacked after losing four of his first seven games, which was exacerbated by poor performances and a lack of supporter confidence. Stefano Pioli was hired as his replacement.[65] After the restart of the Serie A campaign due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Milan went on a 10 match unbeaten streak, winning 7 in the process including matches against Juventus, Lazio and Roma. This streak led to Milan abandoning their plans of hiring Ralf Rangnick as their new manager and sporting director, and instead extended Pioli\\'s contract for a further 2 years.[66] Following a stellar start in the 2020–21 Serie A, which was a continuation of the second half of the previous season, Milan under Pioli in his first full season were led to a second-place finish in the league which was the highest finish for the team since the 2011–12 Serie A. This result allowed Milan to qualify for the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League for the following season, which would become their first appearance in the UEFA Champions League in seven years since their last appearance in the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League.\\n\\nMilan secured their 19th Italian championship title on the last round of the 2021–22 season, with a club-record tally of 86 points. It was their first league title since the 2010–11 season. In the Serie A Awards, Rafael Leão was named as the league\\'s most valuable player, Mike Maignan as the best goalkeeper, and Pioli as coach of the season.[67][68][69] On 1 June 2022, RedBird Capital Partners agreed to acquire AC Milan at $1.3 billion, meanwhile Elliott Management Corporation would keep a minority stake.[70] After five seasons with Milan, Pioli stepped down at the end of 2023–24 season and Paulo Fonseca was named as his replacement.[71]\\n\\nColours and badge\\n\\nWikimedia Commons has media related to AC Milan kits.\\n\\nCoat of arms of the city of Milan – has been the club badge worn on match kits from the origins to the mid-1940s\\nRed and black are the colours which have represented the club throughout its entire history. They were chosen by its founder Herbert Kilpin to represent the players\\' fiery ardor (red) and the opponents\\' fear to challenge the team (black). Rossoneri, the team\\'s widely used nickname, literally means \"the red & blacks\" in Italian, in reference to the colours of the stripes on its jersey.[72]\\n\\nAnother nickname derived from the club\\'s colours is the Devil. An image of a red devil was used as Milan\\'s logo at one point with a Golden Star for Sport Excellence located next to it.[73] As is customary in Italian football, the star above the logo was awarded to the club after winning 10 league titles, in 1979. The official Milan logos have always displayed the Flag of Milan, which was originally the flag of Saint Ambrose,[73] next to red and black stripes. The modern badge used today represents the club colours and the flag of the Comune di Milano, with the acronym ACM at the top and the foundation year (1899) at the bottom.[73] For what concerns the badge worn on match kits, from the origins to the mid-1940s it was simply the flag of Milan. For many decades no club logo was displayed, with the exception of the devil\\'s logo in the early 1980s. The club badge made its definitive appearance on the match strips in the 1995–96, in a form that remained basically unchanged until present days.\\n\\nSince its foundation, the AC Milan home kit consisted of a red and black striped shirt, combined with white shorts and black socks; over the course of the decades, only cyclical changes dictated by the fashions of the time affected this pattern, which remained almost unchanged up to present days. In the first decade of the 20th century, the Rossoneri\\'s first kit was a simple silk shirt characterized by thin stripes, with the badge of the city of Milan sewn at heart level. From the 1910s, the stripes were enlarged following a pattern that would remain unchanged until the late 1950s. The 1960s marked a return to the origins, with the use of thin stripes. This style would last until the 1985–86 season, with a small intermezzo from 1980 to 1982, when the stripes changed to a middle size again. A notable innovation occurred in this period. Between the 1979–80 and 1980–81 seasons, the AC Milan shirt achieved an important record by adding the surnames of the players above the number for the first time in Italian football.[74]\\n\\nFrom the 1986–87 season, under the impulse of the new club owner Silvio Berlusconi, the stripes were brought back to a middle size, and the colour of the socks was changed to white, taking the same colour of the shorts. In such a way, Berlusconi aimed at giving the players a more elegant look, as well as making the kit more distinguishably red and black when watched on the television compared to the thin striped kit, which, at a distance and on the television, could mistaken for a full red or brown shirt.[75] This style continued until 1998. Starting from the 1998–99 season, the kits started to be modified on a yearly basis in their design.\\n\\nMilan\\'s away kit has always been completely white, sometimes adorned with various types of decorations, the most common of which are one vertical or horizontal red and black stripe.[76] The white away kit is considered by both the fans and the club to be a lucky strip in Champions League finals, due to the fact that Milan has won six finals out of eight in an all white strip (losing only to Ajax in 1995 and Liverpool in 2005), and only won one out of three in the home strip. The third strip, which is rarely used, changes yearly, being mostly black with red trimmings.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t think of many shirts out there that are as recognisable as Milan\\'s. – Our kits go beyond just the sphere of football.\"\\n\\n—\\u200aIn an interview with SoccerBible, Milan player Gianluca Lapadula complimented the iconic design of Rossoneri.[77]\\nFirst logo of the \"Milan Foot-Ball and Cricket Club\", used from 1899 to 1916\\nFirst logo of the \"Milan Foot-Ball and Cricket Club\", used from 1899 to 1916\\n \\nMilan logo used between 1936 and 1945\\nMilan logo used between 1936 and 1945\\n \\nMilan logo used between 1946 and 1979, with few variations over the years\\nMilan logo used between 1946 and 1979, with few variations over the years\\n \\nMilan logo used between 1986 and 1998\\nMilan logo used between 1986 and 1998\\n \\nMilan logo used since 1998\\nMilan logo used since 1998\\nAnthem and mascot\\n\"AC Milan Anthem – Milan Milan\" debuted in 1988 and was composed by Tony Renis and Massimo Guantini.[78][79]\\n\\nThe official mascot, designed by Warner Bros., is \"Milanello\", a red devil with the AC Milan kit and a ball.[citation needed]\\n\\nStadiums\\nMain article: San Siro\\n\\nView of the San Siro in 1934\\n\\nCurva Sud of the San Siro\\nMilan played their first matches at the Trotter pitch, located where the Milan Central railway station would later be built. It could not be defined as a stadium, as there were no dressing rooms, no stands and no other facilities. In 1903, Milan moved to the Acquabella pitch, where the stands consisted of a section of ground raised for the purpose. Milan played there until 1905. The following year the club moved to the Porta Monforte pitch, where they played until 1914. The stadium was furnished with a ticket office and wooden stands. In the following years Milan played at the Velodromo Sempione from 1914 to 1920, and at the Viale Lombardia stadium from 1920 to 1926. The latter was a modern structure, with a big main stand and which hosted several games of the Italy national football team.[80]\\n\\nIn 1926 Milan moved to the stadium where they still play nowadays: The San Siro. The stadium,[9] officially known as Stadio Giuseppe Meazza after the former player who represented both Milan and Internazionale, has 75,923 seats. The more commonly used name, \"San Siro\", is the name of the district where it is located. San Siro was privately built by funding from Milan\\'s president at the time, Piero Pirelli. Construction was performed by 120 workers, and took 13+1⁄2 months to complete. The stadium was owned by the club until it was sold to the city in 1935, and since 1947 it has been shared with Internazionale when the other major Milanese club was accepted as joint tenant.\\n\\nThe first game played at the stadium was on 19 September 1926, when Milan lost 6–3 in a friendly match against Internazionale. Milan played its first league game in San Siro on 19 September 1926, losing 1–2 to Sampierdarenese. From an initial capacity of 35,000 spectators, the stadium has undergone several major renovations, most recently in preparation for the 1990 FIFA World Cup when its capacity was set to 85,700, all covered with a polycarbonate roof. In the summer of 2008 its capacity was reduced to 80,018, to meet the new standards set by UEFA.\\n\\nBased on the English model for stadiums, San Siro is specifically designed for football matches, as opposed to many multi-purpose stadiums used in Serie A. It is therefore renowned in Italy for its fantastic atmosphere during matches, largely thanks to the closeness of the stands to the pitch. The frequent use of flares by supporters contributes to the atmosphere but the practice has occasionally caused problems.\\n\\nOn 19 December 2005, Milan vice-president and executive director Adriano Galliani announced that the club was seriously working towards a relocation. He stated Milan\\'s new stadium will be largely based on the Veltins-Arena – the home of Schalke 04 in Gelsenkirchen – and will follow the standards of football stadiums in the United States, Germany and Spain. As opposed to many other stadiums in Italy, Milan\\'s new stadium would likely be used for football only, having no athletics track. On 11 December 2014, Barbara Berlusconi announced a proposal to build a property stadium of 42,000 seats in Portello, behind the new HQ of the Rossoneri, and the large square \"Piazza Gino Valle\". The new village with shopping malls and hotel is located near CityLife district and is served by the metro.[81] On 20 September 2015, however, Silvio Berlusconi called an end to his club\\'s plans to build a new stadium in the city.[82] In 2017, new CEO Marco Fassone stated that the club may look at either staying in the San Siro or moving to a new stadium with the club hierarchy emphasising the need to increase average attendance for home games.[83]\\n\\nOn 27 September 2023, chairman Paolo Scaroni announced the club had filed a proposal to build a new 70,000-seater stadium, alongside the club headquarters and museum in the comune of San Donato Milanese, a suburb south of Milan.[84]\\n\\nSupporters\\nMain article: Fossa dei Leoni\\n\\nBrigate Rossonere\\nMilan is one of the most supported football clubs in Italy, according to research conducted by Italian newspaper La Repubblica.[85] Historically, Milan was supported by the city\\'s working class, which granted them the nickname of casciavid [kaʃaˈʋiːt] (which in Milanese dialect means \"screwdrivers\"), used until the 1960s.[86] On the other hand, crosstown rivals Inter Milan were mainly supported by the more prosperous middle class.[86] The oldest ultras groups in all of Italian football, Fossa dei Leoni, originated in Milan.[87] Currently, the main ultras group within the support base is Brigate Rossonere.[87] Milan ultras have never had any particular political preference,[87] but the media traditionally associated them with the left wing[88] until recently, when Berlusconi\\'s presidency somewhat altered that view.[89]\\n\\nAccording to a study from 2010, Milan is the most supported Italian team in Europe and seventh overall, with over 18.4 million fans.[90] It had the thirteenth highest average attendance of European football clubs during the 2019–20 season, behind Borussia Dortmund, Bayern Munich, Manchester United, Barcelona, Real Madrid, Inter, Schalke 04, Tottenham Hotspur, Celtic, Atlético Madrid, West Ham United and Arsenal.[91]\\n\\nClub rivalries\\nMain articles: Derby della Madonnina and Juventus F.C.–AC Milan rivalry\\n\\nScene of a Derby della Madonnina in 1915\\nMilan\\'s main rivalry is with its neighbour club, Inter Milan. Both clubs meet in the widely anticipated Derby della Madonnina twice every Serie A season. The name of the derby refers to the Blessed Virgin Mary, whose statue atop the Milan Cathedral is one of the city\\'s main attractions. The first match was held in the final of the Chiasso Cup of 1908, a football tournament played in Canton Ticino, Switzerland, on 18 October of that year; the Rossoneri won 2–1.[92] The rivalry reached its highest point in the 1960s, when the two clubs dominated the scene both domestically and internationally. In Italy they cumulatively won five Serie A titles, while internationally they collected four European cups. On the bench it showcased the clash of two different approaches to Catenaccio by the two managers: Nereo Rocco for Milan and Helenio Herrera for Inter. On the pitch the stage was taken by some of the biggest stars the Italian Serie A could offer: players such as Gianni Rivera, Giovanni Trapattoni and José Altafini for Milan and Sandro Mazzola, Giacinto Facchetti and Luis Suárez for Inter. The match usually creates a lively atmosphere, with numerous (often humorous or offensive) banners unfolded before the start of the game. Flares are commonly present and contribute to the spectacle but they have occasionally led to problems, including the abandonment of the second leg of the 2004–05 Champions League quarter-final match between Milan and Inter on 12 April 2005, after a flare thrown from the crowd by an Inter supporter struck Milan goalkeeper Dida on the shoulder.[93]\\n\\nThe rivalry with Juventus F.C. is a rivalry between the two most titled teams in Italy. The challenge confronts also two of the clubs with the greater basin of supporters as well as those with the greatest turnover and stock market value in the country.[94] Milan and Juventus were often fighting for the top positions of the Serie A standings. Some important periods marked by this rivalry were the early 1950s, which saw the two teams alternating each other as Serie A champions (the two clubs won seven titles in the decade), and big duels between forwards, with the Swedish Gre-No-Li on the rossoneri side and the trio formed by Giampiero Boniperti, John Hansen and Karl Aage Præst on the bianconeri side; the early 1970s, when for two consecutive seasons, 1971-72 and 1972-73, Milan lost the scudetto to Juventus by just one point; the 1990s, when the two clubs dominated the league by winning eight (consecutive) titles out of ten, lining up players that marked the history of football in their era and in the whole history; and finally in the 2000s, when, between the 2004–05 and 2005–06 seasons, the two clubs contested each other the Serie A titles, both won by Juventus but then revoked due to the Calciopoli scandal. The only match played by the two teams in European competitions was the 2003 UEFA Champions League final, the first such final between two Italian clubs, won by Milan at the penalties, which granted Milan the sixth Champions League title of their history.[95]\\n\\nThe rivalry with Genoa started at the dawn of the 20th century, when the two clubs repeatedly faced each other for the Italian championship and other important trophies of the time. It then continued in the 1981-82 Serie A season, when Genoa avoided relegation in Naples just a few minutes from the final whistle of the last game of the season condemning the Rossoneri to the second Serie B season of their history. The rivalry worsened in 1995 after Genoa fan Vincenzo Spagnolo was stabbed to death by a Milan supporter.[96] Milan also have rivalries with Fiorentina, Atalanta and Napoli.\\n\\nPopular culture\\nIn the movie industry, among the films dedicated to the Rossoneri team is Sunday Heroes (1953), by director Mario Camerini, in which the main plot pivots around a fictional football match between the Rossoneri and a club on the brink of relegation. In the film appear, in addition to the coach Lajos Czeizler, many of the Milan players of the time, including Lorenzo Buffon, Carlo Annovazzi and the entire Gre-No-Li trio.[citation needed]\\n\\nMilan as a fan base and some of their most popular players appeared in several Italian comedy movies. Among them the following are worth mentioning: Eccezzziunale... veramente, Really SSSupercool: Chapter Two (whose cast includes Paolo Maldini, Gennaro Gattuso, Massimo Ambrosini, Dida, Andriy Shevchenko and Alessandro Costacurta) and Tifosi (whose cast includes Franco Baresi).[citation needed]\\n\\nMilan TV\\nOn 16 December 1999, on the day of the centenary of the club\\'s foundation, Milan Channel was launched. The subscription-based television channel broadcasts news, events and vintage matches of the club. It is the first Italian thematic channel entirely dedicated to a football team. On 1 July 2016, the channel took on the new name of Milan TV, renewing its graphics and logo.[citation needed]\\n\\nForza Milan!\\nIn the editorial field, Forza Milan! was the official magazine of the club for over half a century. It was founded in 1963 by journalist Gino Sansoni and published by Panini. Issued with a monthly cadence, it covered all events surrounding Milan, with interviews to its protagonists, special posters, reports of official and friendly matches. Under the direction of Gigi Vesigna it reached a monthly circulation of 130,000 copies. The last issue of the magazine was published in June 2018.[97]\\n\\nHonours\\nMain articles: List of AC Milan honours, List of AC Milan seasons, and AC Milan in international football\\n\\nA partial view of the club\\'s trophy room at the Mondo Milan Museum\\nWith a total of 32 domestic honours, Milan is one of the most successful clubs in Italy. The club won its first Serie A title in 1901 with its most recent coming in 2022. Milan\\'s tenth scudetto win meant that it earned the right to place a star on its jersey in recognition of this.\\n\\nMilan is the most successful Italian club in international football with 20 major international trophies won (18 of them organised by UEFA and FIFA), and the third most successful in Europe overall after Real Madrid and Barcelona. They have won the European Cup/Champions League seven times, an Italian record and only surpassed by Real Madrid, with their most recent coming in 2007. Milan\\'s fifth European Cup win, in 1994, meant that the club was awarded the trophy permanently and is allowed to display a multiple-winner badge on its shirt.[98] The club also holds a joint record of two wins in the Latin Cup and a joint record of three wins in the Intercontinental Cup.

He went on to become Milan\\'s all-time top goalscorer, scoring 221 goals for the club in 268 games.[101] He is followed in second place by Andriy Shevchenko with 175 goals in 322 games, and Gianni Rivera in third place, who has scored 164 goals in 658 games. Rivera is also Milan\\'s youngest ever goalscorer, scoring in a league match against Juventus at just 17 years.\\n\\nLegendary tactician Nereo Rocco, the first proponent of catenaccio in the country, was Milan\\'s longest-serving manager, sitting on the bench for over nine years (in two spells) in the 1960s and early 1970s, winning the club\\'s first European Cup triumphs. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who purchased the club in 1986, is Milan\\'s longest-serving president (23 years, due to a two-year vacancy between 2004 and 2006).\\n\\nThe first official match in which Milan participated was in the Third Federal Football Championship, the predecessor of Serie A, losing 3–0 to Torinese. Milan\\'s largest ever victory was 13–0 against Audax Modena, in a league match at the 1914–15 season. Its heaviest defeat was recorded in the league at the 1922–23 season, beaten 0–8 by Bologna.\\n\\nDuring the 1991–92 season, the club achieved the feature of being the first team to win the Serie A title without losing a single game. Previously, only Perugia had managed to go unbeaten over an entire Serie A season (1978–79), but finished second in the table. In total, Milan\\'s unbeaten streak lasted 58 games, starting with a 0–0 draw against Parma on 26 May 1991 and coincidentally ending with a 1–0 home loss to Parma on 21 March 1993. This is a Serie A record as well as the third-longest unbeaten run in top flight European football, coming in behind Steaua București\\'s record of 104 unbeaten games and Celtic\\'s 68 game unbeaten run.[13][102]\\n\\nSince 2007, along with Boca Juniors, Milan has won more FIFA recognised international club titles than any other club in the world with 18 titles.[103] They were overtaken by Al Ahly SC from Egypt after their 2014 CAF Confederation Cup win.[104]\\n\\nThe sale of Kaká to Real Madrid in 2009 broke the eight-year-old world football transfer record held by Zinedine Zidane, costing the Spanish club €67 million[105] (about £56 million[106]). That record, however, lasted for less than a month, broken by Cristiano Ronaldo\\'s £80 million transfer.[107] This record, however, is in terms of nominal British pound rates, not adjusted to inflation or the real value of the euro. Madrid bought Zidane for €77.5 million in 2001,[108][109] about £46 million at that time.',\n",
       " 'Manchester United F.C.': 'Manchester United Football Club, commonly referred to as Man United (often stylised as Man Utd), is a professional football club based in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, England. They compete in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. Nicknamed the Red Devils, they were founded as Newton Heath LYR Football Club in 1878, but changed their name to Manchester United in 1902. After a spell playing in Clayton, Manchester, the club moved to their current stadium, Old Trafford, in 1910.\\n\\nDomestically, Manchester United have won a record 20 top-flight league titles, 13 FA Cups, 6 League Cups and a record 21 FA Community Shields. Additionally, in international football, they have won the European Cup/UEFA Champions League three times, and the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners\\' Cup, the UEFA Super Cup, the Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup once each.[7][8] Appointed as manager in 1945, Matt Busby built a team with an average age of just 22 nicknamed the Busby Babes that won successive league titles in the 1950s and became the first English club to compete in the European Cup. Eight players were killed in the Munich air disaster, but Busby rebuilt the team around star players George Best, Denis Law and Bobby Charlton – known as the United Trinity. They won two more league titles before becoming the first English club to win the European Cup in 1968.\\n\\nAfter Busby\\'s retirement, Manchester United were unable to produce sustained success until the arrival of Alex Ferguson, who became the club\\'s longest-serving and most successful manager, winning 38 trophies including 13 league titles, five FA Cups and two Champions League titles between 1986 and 2013.[9] In the 1998–99 season, under Ferguson, the club became the first in the history of English football to achieve the continental treble of the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League.[10] In winning the UEFA Europa League under José Mourinho in 2016–17, they became one of five clubs to have won the original three main UEFA club competitions (the Champions League, Europa League and Cup Winners\\' Cup).\\n\\nManchester United is one of the most widely supported football clubs in the world[11][12] and have rivalries with Liverpool, Manchester City, Arsenal and Leeds United. Manchester United was the highest-earning football club in the world for 2016–17, with an annual revenue of €676.3 million,[13] and the world\\'s third-most-valuable football club in 2019, valued at £3.15 billion ($3.81 billion).[14] After being floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club was taken private in 2005 after a purchase by American businessman Malcolm Glazer valued at almost £800 million, of which over £500 million of borrowed money became the club\\'s debt.[15] From 2012, some shares of the club were listed on the New York Stock Exchange, although the Glazer family retains overall ownership and control of the club.\\n\\nHistory\\nSee also: List of Manchester United F.C. seasons\\nrefer to caption\\nA chart showing the progress of Manchester United through the English football league system, from joining as Newton Heath in 1892–93 to the present\\nEarly years (1878–1945)\\nMain article: History of Manchester United F.C. (1878–1945)\\nManchester United were formed in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club by the Carriage and Wagon department of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) depot at Newton Heath.[16] The team initially played games against other departments and railway companies, but on 20 November 1880, they competed in their first recorded match; wearing the colours of the railway company – green and gold – they were defeated 6–0 by Bolton Wanderers\\' reserve team.[17] By 1888, the club had become a founding member of The Combination, a regional football league. Following the league\\'s dissolution after only one season, Newton Heath joined the newly formed Football Alliance, which ran for three seasons before being merged with The Football League. This resulted in the club starting the 1892–93 season in the First Division, by which time it had become independent of the railway company and dropped the \"LYR\" from its name.[16] After two seasons, the club was relegated to the Second Division.[16]\\n\\nA black-and-white photograph of a football team lining up before a match.

Two men in suits are standing on either side of the players.\\nThe Manchester United team at the start of the 1905–06 season, in which they were runners-up in the Second Division\\nIn January 1902, with debts of £2,670 – equivalent to £370,000 in 2025[nb 1] – the club was served with a winding-up order.[18] Captain Harry Stafford found four local businessmen, including John Henry Davies (who became club president), each willing to invest £500 in return for a direct interest in running the club and who subsequently changed the name;[19] on 24 April 1902, Manchester United was officially born.[20][nb 2] Under Ernest Mangnall, who assumed managerial duties in 1903, Manchester United finished as Second Division runners-up in 1906 and secured promotion to the First Division, which they won in 1908 – the club\\'s first league title. The following season began with victory in the first ever Charity Shield[21] and ended with the club\\'s first FA Cup title. Mangnall was considered a significant influence behind the team\\'s move to Old Trafford in 1910, and Manchester United won the First Division for the second time in 1911.[22] At the end of the following season, however, Mangnall left the club to join Manchester City.[23]\\n\\nIn 1922, three years after the resumption of football following the First World War, the club was relegated to the Second Division, where it remained until regaining promotion in 1925. Relegated again in 1931, Manchester United became a yo-yo club, achieving its all-time lowest position of 20th place in the Second Division in 1934, under secretary-manager Scott Duncan, narrowly avoiding relegation to the Third Division. Two years later, Duncan led the club to promotion before another relegation followed in 1937, which led to his resignation in November of that year. Following the death of principal benefactor John Henry Davies in October 1927, the club\\'s finances deteriorated to the extent that Manchester United would likely have gone bankrupt had it not been for James W. Gibson, who, in December 1931, invested £2,000 and assumed control of the club.[24] In the 1938–39 season, the last year of football before the Second World War, the club finished 14th in the First Division.[24]\\n\\nBusby years (1945–1969)\\nMain article: History of Manchester United F.C.

Manager Matt Busby is pictured front right.\\nIn October 1945, the impending resumption of football after the war led to the managerial appointment of Matt Busby, who demanded an unprecedented level of control over team selection, player transfers and training sessions.[25] Busby led the team to second-place league finishes in 1947, 1948 and 1949, and to FA Cup victory in 1948. In 1952, the club won the First Division, its first league title for 41 years.[26] They then won back-to-back league titles in 1956 and 1957; the squad, who had an average age of 22, were nicknamed \"the Busby Babes\" by the media, a testament to Busby\\'s faith in his youth players.[27] In 1957, Manchester United became the first English team to compete in the European Cup, despite objections from The Football League, who had denied Chelsea the same opportunity the previous season.[28] En route to the semi-final, which they lost to Real Madrid, the team recorded a 10–0 victory over Belgian champions Anderlecht, which remains the club\\'s biggest victory on record.[29]\\n\\nA stone tablet, inscribed with the image of a football pitch and several names.

The Munich air disaster of 6 February 1958 claimed 23 lives, including those of eight players – Geoff Bent, Roger Byrne, Eddie Colman, Duncan Edwards, Mark Jones, David Pegg, Tommy Taylor and Billy Whelan – and injured several more.[30][31]\\n\\n\\nThe United Trinity statue of George Best (left), Denis Law (centre) and Bobby Charlton (right) outside Old Trafford\\nAssistant manager Jimmy Murphy took over as manager while Busby recovered from his injuries and the club\\'s makeshift side reached the FA Cup final, which they lost to Bolton Wanderers. In recognition of the team\\'s tragedy, UEFA invited the club to compete in the 1958–59 European Cup alongside eventual League champions Wolverhampton Wanderers. Despite approval from The Football Association, The Football League determined that the club should not enter the competition, since it had not qualified.[32][33] Busby rebuilt the team through the 1960s by signing players such as Denis Law and Paddy Crerand, who combined with the next generation of youth players – including George Best – to win the FA Cup in 1963. Busby rested several key players for the League game before the Cup Final which gave Dennis Walker the chance to make his debut against Nottingham Forest on 20 May. Walker thus became the first Black player to represent United.[34] The following season, they finished second in the league, then won the title in 1965 and 1967. In 1968, Manchester United became the first English club to win the European Cup, beating Benfica 4–1 in the final[35] with a team that contained three European Footballers of the Year: Bobby Charlton, Denis Law and George Best.[36] They then represented Europe in the 1968 Intercontinental Cup against Estudiantes of Argentina, but defeat in the first leg in Buenos Aires meant a 1–1 draw at Old Trafford three weeks later was not enough to claim the title. Busby resigned as manager in 1969 before being replaced by the reserve team coach, former Manchester United player Wilf McGuinness.[37]\\n\\n1969–1986\\nMain article: History of Manchester United F.C.

In June 1971, Frank O\\'Farrell was appointed as manager, but lasted less than 18 months before being replaced by Tommy Docherty in December 1972.[39] Docherty saved Manchester United from relegation that season, only to see them relegated in 1974; by that time the trio of Best, Law, and Charlton had left the club.[35] The team won promotion at the first attempt and reached the FA Cup final in 1976, but were beaten by Southampton. They reached the final again in 1977, beating Liverpool 2–1. Docherty was dismissed shortly afterwards, following the revelation of his affair with the club physiotherapist\\'s wife.[37][40]\\n\\nDave Sexton replaced Docherty as manager in the summer of 1977. Despite major signings, including Joe Jordan, Gordon McQueen, Gary Bailey, and Ray Wilkins, the team failed to win any trophies; they finished second in 1979–80 and lost to Arsenal in the 1979 FA Cup final. Sexton was dismissed in 1981, even though the team won the last seven games under his direction.[41] He was replaced by Ron Atkinson, who immediately broke the British record transfer fee to sign Bryan Robson from his former club West Bromwich Albion. Under Atkinson, Manchester United won the FA Cup in 1983 and 1985 and beat rivals Liverpool to win the 1983 Charity Shield. In 1985–86, after 13 wins and two draws in its first 15 matches, the club was favourite to win the league but finished in fourth place. The following season, with the club in danger of relegation by November, Atkinson was dismissed.[42]\\n\\nFerguson years (1986–2013)\\nMain article: History of Manchester United F.C.

That triumph allowed the club to compete in the European Super Cup for the first time, where United beat European Cup holders Red Star Belgrade 1–0 at Old Trafford. The club appeared in two consecutive League Cup finals in 1991 and 1992, beating Nottingham Forest 1–0 in the second to win that competition for the first time as well.[42] In 1993, in the first season of the newly founded Premier League, the club won their first league title since 1967, and a year later, for the first time since 1957, they won a second consecutive title – alongside the FA Cup – to complete the first \"Double\" in the club\\'s history.[42] United then became the first English club to do the Double twice when they won both competitions again in 1995–96,[48] before retaining the league title once more in 1996–97 with a game to spare.[49]\\n\\n\\nFront three: Manchester United\\'s treble medals of the 1998–99 season are displayed at the club\\'s museum.\\nIn the 1998–99 season, Manchester United became the first team to win the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League – \"The Treble\" – in the same season.[50] Trailing 1–0 going into injury time in the 1999 UEFA Champions League final, Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjær scored late goals to claim a dramatic victory over Bayern Munich, in what is considered one of the greatest comebacks of all time.[51] That summer, Ferguson received a knighthood for his services to football.[52]\\n\\nIn November 1999, the club became the only British team to ever win the Intercontinental Cup with a 1–0 victory over the strong 1999 Copa Libertadores winners Palmeiras in Tokyo. The Red Devils counted on an unexpected goalkeeper fail by future 2002 FIFA World Cup winner Marcos and a disallowed goal scored by Alex to win the game.[53]\\n\\nA white football player with short, dark, greying hair.

The team finished third in 2001–02, before regaining the title in 2002–03.[55] They won the 2003–04 FA Cup, beating Millwall 3–0 in the final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff to lift the trophy for a record 11th time.[56] In the 2005–06 season, Manchester United failed to qualify for the knockout phase of the UEFA Champions League for the first time in over a decade,[57] but recovered to secure a second-place league finish and victory over Wigan Athletic in the 2006 Football League Cup final. The club regained the Premier League title in the 2006–07 season, before completing the European double in 2007–08 with a 6–5 penalty shoot-out victory over Chelsea in the 2008 UEFA Champions League final in Moscow to go with their 17th English league title. Ryan Giggs made a record 759th appearance for the club in that game, overtaking previous record holder Bobby Charlton.[58] In December 2008, the club became the first British team to win the FIFA Club World Cup after beating LDU Quito 1–0 in the final. Manchester United followed this with the 2008–09 Football League Cup, and its third successive Premier League title.[59][60] That summer, forward Cristiano Ronaldo was sold to Real Madrid for a world record £80 million.[61] In 2010, Manchester United defeated Aston Villa 2–1 at Wembley to retain the League Cup, its first successful defence of a knockout cup competition.[62]\\n\\nAfter finishing as runners-up to Chelsea in the 2009–10 season, United achieved a record 19th league title in 2010–11, securing the championship with a 1–1 away draw against Blackburn Rovers on 14 May 2011.[63] This was extended to 20 league titles in 2012–13, securing the championship with a 3–0 home win against Aston Villa on 22 April 2013.[64]\\n\\nPost-Ferguson decline (2013–present)\\nOn 8 May 2013, Ferguson announced that he was to retire as manager at the end of the football season, but would remain at the club as a director and club ambassador.[65][66] He retired as the most decorated manager in football history.[67][68] The club announced the next day that Everton manager David Moyes would replace him from 1 July, having signed a six-year contract.[69][70][71] Ryan Giggs took over as interim player-manager 10 months later, on 22 April 2014, when Moyes was sacked after a poor season in which the club failed to defend their Premier League title and failed to qualify for the UEFA Champions League for the first time since 1995–96.[72] They also failed to qualify for the UEFA Europa League, the first time Manchester United had not qualified for a European competition since 1990.[73] On 19 May 2014, it was confirmed that Louis van Gaal would replace Moyes as Manchester United manager on a three-year deal, with Giggs as his assistant.[74] Malcolm Glazer, the patriarch of the family that owns the club, died on 28 May 2014.[75]\\n\\n\\nWayne Rooney receiving an award for becoming the club\\'s record goalscorer from previous record holder Sir Bobby Charlton in January 2017\\nUnder Van Gaal, United won a 12th FA Cup, but a disappointing slump in the middle of his second season led to rumours of the board sounding out potential replacements.[76] Van Gaal was ultimately sacked just two days after the cup final victory, with United having finished fifth in the league.[77] Former Porto, Chelsea, Inter Milan and Real Madrid manager José Mourinho was appointed in his place on 27 May 2016.[78] Mourinho signed a three-year contract, and in his first season won the FA Community Shield, EFL Cup and UEFA Europa League. Wayne Rooney scored his 250th goal for United, a stoppage-time equaliser in a league game against Stoke City in January 2017, surpassing Sir Bobby Charlton as the club\\'s all-time top scorer.[79] The following season, United finished second in the league – their highest league placing since 2013 – but were still 19 points behind rivals Manchester City. Mourinho also guided the club to a 19th FA Cup final, but they lost 1–0 to Chelsea. On 18 December 2018, with United in sixth place in the Premier League table, 19 points behind leaders Liverpool and 11 points outside the Champions League places, Mourinho was sacked after 144 games in charge. The following day, former United striker Ole Gunnar Solskjær was appointed as caretaker manager until the end of the season.[80] On 28 March 2019, after winning 14 of his first 19 matches in charge, Solskjær was appointed permanent manager on a three-year deal.[81]\\n\\nOn 18 April 2021, Manchester United announced they were joining 11 other European clubs as founding members of the European Super League, a proposed 20-team competition intended to rival the UEFA Champions League.[82] The announcement drew a significant backlash from supporters, other clubs, media partners, sponsors, players and the UK Government, forcing the club to withdraw just two days later.[83][84][85][86][87] The failure of the project led to the resignation of executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, while resultant protests against Woodward and the Glazer family led to a pitch invasion ahead of a league match against Liverpool on 2 May 2021, which saw the first postponement of a Premier League game due to supporter protests in the competition\\'s history.[88][89]\\n\\nOn the pitch, United equalled their own record for the biggest win in Premier League history with a 9–0 win over Southampton on 2 February 2021,[90] but ended the season with defeat on penalties in the UEFA Europa League final against Villarreal, going four straight seasons without a trophy.[91] On 20 November 2021, Solskjær left his role as manager.[92] Former midfielder Michael Carrick took charge for the next three games, before the appointment of Ralf Rangnick as interim manager until the end of the season.[93]\\n\\nOn 21 April 2022, Erik ten Hag was appointed as the manager from the end of the 2021–22 season, signing a contract until June 2025 with the option of extending for a further year.[94] Under Ten Hag, Manchester United won the 2022–23 EFL Cup, defeating Newcastle United in the final to end their longest period without a trophy since a six-year span between 1977 and 1983.[95][96] On 5 March 2023, the club suffered their joint-heaviest defeat, losing 7–0 to rivals Liverpool at Anfield.[97] At the end of the following season, the club finished eighth in the Premier League, their lowest league finish since the 1989–90 season, but went on to beat cross-city rivals Manchester City 2–1 in the FA Cup final, to win their 13th FA Cup title.[98] On 28 October 2024, Manchester United sacked Erik ten Hag after the club managed just three wins in the opening nine games of the Premier League season.[99] On 1 November 2024, Manchester United announced that they would be appointing Sporting CP boss Ruben Amorim as their new head coach from 11 November 2024.[100]\\n\\nCrest and colours\\n\\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Manchester United F.C. kits.\\n\\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Manchester United F.C. kits (alternates).\\n\\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Manchester United F.C. kits (goalkeeper kits).\\nA football crest.

The upper scroll is red and reads \"Manchester United\" in black type, while the lower scroll is white with \"Football Club\" also written in black\\nManchester United badge in the 1960s\\nThe club crest is derived from the Manchester City Council coat of arms, although all that remains of it on the current crest is the ship in full sail.[101] The devil stems from the club\\'s nickname \"The Red Devils\" inspired from Salford Rugby Club;[102][103] it was included on club programmes and scarves in the 1960s, and incorporated into the club crest in 1970, although the crest was not included on the chest of the shirt until 1971.[101] In 1975, the red devil (\"A devil facing the sinister guardant supporting with both hands a trident gules\") was granted as a heraldic badge by the College of Arms to the English Football League for use by Manchester United.[104] In 2023, the Red Devil motif alone, which had been used in promotional items and merchandise previously, was used as the sole badge on the Manchester United third kit. The existing crest remains on the home and away kits.\\n\\nNewton Heath\\'s uniform in 1879, four years before the club played its first competitive match, has been documented as \"white with blue cord\".[105] A photograph of the Newton Heath team, taken in 1892, is believed to show the players wearing red-and-white quartered jerseys and navy blue knickerbockers.[106] Between 1894 and 1896, the players wore green and gold jerseys[106] which were replaced in 1896 by white shirts, which were worn with navy blue shorts.[106]\\n\\nAfter the name change in 1902, the club colours were changed to red shirts, white shorts, and black socks, which has become the standard Manchester United home kit.[106] Very few changes were made to the kit until 1922 when the club adopted white shirts bearing a deep red \"V\" around the neck, similar to the shirt worn in the 1909 FA Cup final. They remained part of their home kits until 1927.[106] For a period in 1934, the cherry and white hooped change shirt became the home colours, but the following season the red shirt was recalled after the club\\'s lowest ever league placing of 20th in the Second Division and the hooped shirt dropped back to being the change.[106]\\n\\nThe black socks were changed to white from 1959 to 1965, where they were replaced with red socks up until 1971 with white used on occasion, when the club reverted to black. Black shorts and white socks are sometimes worn with the home strip, most often in away games, if there is a clash with the opponent\\'s kit. For 2018–19, black shorts and red socks became the primary choice for the home kit.[107] Since 1997–98, white socks have been the preferred choice for European games, which are typically played on weeknights, to aid with player visibility.[108] The current home kit is a red shirt with Adidas\\' trademark three stripes in red on the shoulders, white shorts, and black socks.[109]\\n\\nThe Manchester United away strip has often been a white shirt, black shorts and white socks, but there have been several exceptions. These include an all-black strip with blue and gold trimmings between 1993 and 1995, the navy blue shirt with silver horizontal pinstripes worn during the 1999–2000 season,[110] and the 2011–12 away kit, which had a royal blue body and sleeves with hoops made of small midnight navy blue and black stripes, with black shorts and blue socks.[111] An all-grey away kit worn during the 1995–96 season was dropped after just five games; in its final outing against Southampton, Alex Ferguson instructed the team to change into the third kit during half-time. The reason for dropping it being that the players claimed to have trouble finding their teammates against the crowd, United failed to win a competitive game in the kit in five attempts.[112] In 2001, to celebrate 100 years as \"Manchester United\", a reversible white and gold away kit was released, although the actual match day shirts were not reversible.[113] Since 2016, the team has experimented with various colors and design, going away from the traditional white.\\n\\nThe club\\'s third kit was traditionally all-blue; this was most recently the case during the 2014–15 season.[114] Exceptions include a green-and-gold halved shirt worn between 1992 and 1994, a blue-and-white striped shirt worn during the 1994–95 and 1995–96 seasons and once in 1996–97, an all-black kit worn during the Treble-winning 1998–99 season, and a white shirt with black-and-red horizontal pinstripes worn between 2003–04 and 2005–06.[115] From 2006–07 to 2013–14, the third kit was the previous season\\'s away kit, albeit updated with the new club sponsor in 2006–07 and 2010–11, apart from the 2008–09 season, when an all-blue kit was launched to mark the 40th anniversary of the 1967–68 European Cup success.[116]\\n\\nGrounds\\nA stand of a football stadium.

H. Albut procured the use of the Bank Street ground in Clayton.[121] It initially had no stands, by the start of the 1893–94 season, two had been built; one spanning the full length of the pitch on one side and the other behind the goal at the \"Bradford end\". At the opposite end, the \"Clayton end\", the ground had been \"built up, thousands thus being provided for\".[121] Newton Heath\\'s first league match at Bank Street was played against Burnley on 1 September 1893, when 10,000 people saw Alf Farman score a hat-trick, Newton Heath\\'s only goals in a 3–2 win. The remaining stands were completed for the following league game against Nottingham Forest three weeks later.[121] In October 1895, before the visit of Manchester City, the club purchased a 2,000-capacity stand from the Broughton Rangers rugby league club, and put up another stand on the \"reserved side\" (as distinct from the \"popular side\"); however, weather restricted the attendance for the Manchester City match to just 12,000.[122]\\n\\nWhen the Bank Street ground was temporarily closed by bailiffs in 1902, club captain Harry Stafford raised enough money to pay for the club\\'s next away game at Bristol City and found a temporary ground at Harpurhey for the next reserves game against Padiham.[123] Following financial investment, new club president John Henry Davies paid £500 for the erection of a new 1,000-seat stand at Bank Street.[124] Within four years, the stadium had cover on all four sides, as well as the ability to hold approximately 50,000 spectators, some of whom could watch from the viewing gallery atop the Main Stand.[124]\\n\\n1910–present: Old Trafford\\nMain article: Old Trafford\\nFollowing Manchester United\\'s first league title in 1908 and the FA Cup a year later, it was decided that Bank Street was too restrictive for Davies\\' ambition;[124] in February 1909, six weeks before the club\\'s first FA Cup title, Old Trafford was named as the home of Manchester United, following the purchase of land for around £60,000. Architect Archibald Leitch was given a budget of £30,000 for construction; original plans called for seating capacity of 100,000, though budget constraints forced a revision to 77,000.[125][126] The building was constructed by Messrs Brameld and Smith of Manchester. The stadium\\'s record attendance was registered on 25 March 1939, when an FA Cup semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town drew 76,962 spectators.[127]\\n\\nBombing in the Second World War destroyed much of the stadium; the central tunnel in the South Stand was all that remained of that quarter. After the war, the club received compensation from the War Damage Commission in the amount of £22,278. While reconstruction took place, the team played its \"home\" games at Manchester City\\'s Maine Road ground; Manchester United was charged £5,000 per year, plus a nominal percentage of gate receipts.[128] Later improvements included the addition of roofs, first to the Stretford End and then to the North and East Stands. The roofs were supported by pillars that obstructed many fans\\' views, and they were eventually replaced with a cantilevered structure. The Stretford End was the last stand to receive a cantilevered roof, completed in time for the 1993–94 season.[37] First used on 25 March 1957 and costing £40,000, four 180-foot (55 m) pylons were erected, each housing 54 individual floodlights. These were dismantled in 1987 and replaced by a lighting system embedded in the roof of each stand, which remains in use today.[129]\\n\\nThe Taylor Report\\'s requirement for an all-seater stadium lowered capacity at Old Trafford to around 44,000 by 1993. In 1995, the North Stand was redeveloped into three tiers, restoring capacity to approximately 55,000. At the end of the 1998–99 season, second tiers were added to the East and West Stands, raising capacity to around 67,000, and between July 2005 and May 2006, 8,000 more seats were added via second tiers in the north-west and north-east quadrants. Part of the new seating was used for the first time on 26 March 2006, when an attendance of 69,070 became a new Premier League record.[130] The record was pushed steadily upwards before reaching its peak on 31 March 2007, when 76,098 spectators saw Manchester United beat Blackburn Rovers 4–1, with just 114 seats (0.15 per cent of the total capacity of 76,212) unoccupied.[131] In 2009, reorganisation of the seating resulted in a reduction of capacity by 255 to 75,957.[132][133] Manchester United has the second highest average attendance among European football clubs, behind only Borussia Dortmund.[134][135][136]\\n\\nProposed new ground\\nMain article: New Trafford Stadium\\nIn 2021, United co-chairman Joel Glazer said that \"early-stage planning work\" for the redevelopment of Old Trafford was underway. This followed \"increasing criticism\" over the lack of development of the ground since 2006.[137] After the club\\'s takeover by Sir Jim Ratcliffe in 2024, it emerged that plans were being made for the construction of a new, 100,000-capacity stadium near Old Trafford and that the current stadium would be downsized to serve as the home for the women\\'s team and the club\\'s academy.[138] In November 2024, it was revealed that the majority of fans surveyed are in favour of a new-build rather than redevelopment.[139]\\n\\nOn 11 March 2025, the club announced that it had retained Foster and Partners to construct a new, 100,000-capacity stadium adjacent to Old Trafford.[140] The new stadium is under consideration as a host venue for the 2035 FIFA Women\\'s World Cup.[141]\\n\\nSupport\\nAnthem of Manchester United FC\\nDuration: 3 minutes and 1 second.3:01\\n\\nAverage Old Trafford Manchester United attendance, 1949–2009\\nManchester United is one of the most popular football clubs in the world, with one of the highest average home attendances in Europe.[142] The club states that its worldwide fan base includes more than 200 officially recognised branches of the Manchester United Supporters Club (MUSC), in at least 24 countries.[143] The club takes advantage of this support through its worldwide summer tours. Accountancy firm and sports industry consultants Deloitte estimate that Manchester United has 75 million fans worldwide.[11] The club has the third highest social media following in the world among sports teams (after Barcelona and Real Madrid), with over 82 million Facebook followers as of July 2023.[12][144] A 2014 study showed that Manchester United had the loudest fans in the Premier League.[145]\\n\\nSupporters are represented by two independent bodies; the Independent Manchester United Supporters\\' Association (IMUSA), which maintains close links to the club through the MUFC Fans Forum,[146] and the Manchester United Supporters\\' Trust (MUST). After the Glazer family\\'s takeover in 2005, a group of fans formed a splinter club, F.C. United of Manchester. The West Stand of Old Trafford – the \"Stretford End\" – is the home end and the traditional source of the club\\'s most vocal support.[147]\\n\\nRivalries\\nManchester United has high-profile rivalries with Liverpool and local neighbours Manchester City. The club has also had rivalries throughout its history with the likes of Arsenal, Leeds United and Chelsea.[148][149]\\n\\n\\nLiverpool v Manchester United at Old Trafford on 14 March 2009\\nThe matches against Manchester City are known as the Manchester derby, as they are the two most important teams in the city of Manchester. It is considered one of the biggest local derbies in British football,[150] particularly after City\\'s rise to prominence in the 2010s and the two clubs fighting for trophies, such as the league title in 2012 and 2013, as well as two consecutive FA Cup finals in 2023 and 2024.[151]\\n\\nThe rivalry with Liverpool is rooted in competition between the cities during the Industrial Revolution, when Manchester was famous for its textile industry while Liverpool was a major port.[152] The two clubs are the most successful in the history of English football; between them they have won 39 league titles, 9 European Cups, 21 FA Cups, 16 League Cups, 4 UEFA Cup/Europa Leagues, 2 FIFA Club World Cups, 1 Intercontinental Cup, 37 FA Community Shields and 5 UEFA Super Cups.[7][153][154] Ranked the two biggest clubs in England by France Football magazine based on metrics such as fanbase and historical importance,[155] matches between Manchester United and Liverpool are considered to be the most famous fixture in English football and one of the biggest rivalries in the football world.[156][157][158][159] No player has been transferred between the clubs since 1964.[160] Former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said in 2002, \"My greatest challenge was knocking Liverpool right off their fucking perch\".[161]\\n\\nThe \"Roses Rivalry\" with Leeds stems from the Wars of the Roses, fought between the House of Lancaster and the House of York, with Manchester United representing Lancashire and Leeds representing Yorkshire.[162]\\n\\nThe rivalry with Arsenal arose from the numerous times the two teams battled for the Premier League title, especially under managers Alex Ferguson and Arsène Wenger, who also had a heated personal rivalry.[163] With 33 titles between them (20 for Manchester United, 13 for Arsenal), the fixture has been described as a \"blockbuster\" and the \"greatest\" rivalry in the history of the Premier League.[164][165]\\n\\nGlobal brand\\nManchester United has been described as a global brand; a 2011 report by Brand Finance, valued the club\\'s trademarks and associated intellectual property at £412 million – an increase of £39 million on the previous year, valuing it at £11 million more than the second best brand, Real Madrid – and gave the brand a strength rating of AAA (Extremely Strong).[166] In July 2012, Manchester United was ranked first by Forbes magazine in its list of the ten most valuable sports team brands, valuing the Manchester United brand at $2.23 billion.[167] The club is ranked third in the Deloitte Football Money League (behind Real Madrid and Barcelona).[168] In January 2013, the club became the first sports team in the world to be valued at $3 billion.[169] Forbes magazine valued the club at $3.3 billion – $1.2 billion higher than the next most valuable sports team.[169] They were overtaken by Real Madrid for the next four years, but Manchester United returned to the top of the Forbes list in June 2017, with a valuation of $3.689 billion.[170]\\n\\n\\nAn official partner of the club, Turkish Airlines, in Manchester United livery\\nThe core strength of Manchester United\\'s global brand is often attributed to Matt Busby\\'s rebuilding of the team and subsequent success following the Munich air disaster, which drew worldwide acclaim.[147] The \"iconic\" team included Bobby Charlton and Nobby Stiles (members of England\\'s World Cup winning team), Denis Law and George Best. The attacking style of play adopted by this team (in contrast to the defensive-minded \"catenaccio\" approach favoured by the leading Italian teams of the era) \"captured the imagination of the English footballing public\".[171] Busby\\'s team also became associated with the liberalisation of Western society during the 1960s; George Best, known as the \"Fifth Beatle\" for his iconic haircut, was the first footballer to significantly develop an off-the-field media profile.[171]\\n\\nAs the second English football club to float on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club raised significant capital, with which it further developed its commercial strategy. The club\\'s focus on commercial and sporting success brought significant profits in an industry often characterised by chronic losses.[172] The strength of the Manchester United brand was bolstered by intense off-the-field media attention to individual players, most notably David Beckham (who quickly developed his own global brand). This attention often generates greater interest in on-the-field activities, and hence generates sponsorship opportunities – the value of which is driven by television exposure.[173] During his time with the club, Beckham\\'s popularity across Asia was integral to the club\\'s commercial success in that part of the world.[174]\\n\\nBecause higher league placement results in a greater share of television rights, success on the field generates greater income for the club. Since the inception of the Premier League, Manchester United has received the largest share of the revenue generated from the BSkyB broadcasting deal.[175] Manchester United has also consistently enjoyed the highest commercial income of any English club; in 2005–06, the club\\'s commercial arm generated £51 million, compared to £42.5 million at Chelsea, £39.3 million at Liverpool, £34 million at Arsenal and £27.9 million at Newcastle United. A key sponsorship relationship was with sportswear company Nike, who managed the club\\'s merchandising operation as part of a £303 million 13-year partnership between 2002 and 2015.[176] Through Manchester United Finance and the club\\'s membership scheme, One United, those with an affinity for the club can purchase a range of branded goods and services. Additionally, Manchester United-branded media services – such as the club\\'s dedicated television channel, MUTV – have allowed the club to expand its fan base to those beyond the reach of its Old Trafford stadium.[11]\\n\\nSponsorship\\nPeriod\\tKit manufacturer\\tShirt sponsor (chest)\\tShirt sponsor (sleeve)\\tShirt sponsor (back)\\n1945–1975\\tUmbro\\t—\\t—\\t—\\n1975–1980\\tAdmiral\\n1980–1982\\tAdidas\\n1982–1992\\tSharp Electronics[177]\\n1992–2000\\tUmbro\\n2000–2002\\tVodafone[177]\\n2002–2006\\tNike\\n2006–2010\\tAIG[177]\\n2010–2014\\tAon[177]\\n2014–2015\\tChevrolet[177]\\n2015–2018\\tAdidas\\n2018–2021\\tKohler\\n2021–2022\\tTeamViewer\\n2022–2024\\tDXC Technology\\n2024–\\tSnapdragon\\tMicrosoft Copilot+ PC (League Cup)\\nIn an initial five-year deal worth £500,000, Sharp Electronics became the club\\'s first shirt sponsor at the beginning of the 1982–83 season, a relationship that lasted until the end of the 1999–2000 season, when Vodafone agreed a four-year, £30 million deal.[178] Vodafone agreed to pay £36 million to extend the deal by four years, but after two seasons triggered a break clause in order to concentrate on its sponsorship of the Champions League.[178]\\n\\nTo commence at the start of the 2006–07 season, American insurance corporation AIG agreed a four-year £56.5 million deal which in September 2006 became the most valuable in the world.[179][180] At the beginning of the 2010–11 season, American reinsurance company Aon became the club\\'s principal sponsor in a four-year deal reputed to be worth approximately £80 million, making it the most lucrative shirt sponsorship deal in football history.[181] Manchester United announced their first training kit sponsor in August 2011, agreeing a four-year deal with DHL reported to be worth £40 million; it is believed to be the first instance of training kit sponsorship in English football.[182][183] The DHL contract lasted for over a year before the club bought back the contract in October 2012, although they remained the club\\'s official logistics partner.[184] The contract for the training kit sponsorship was then sold to Aon in April 2013 for a deal worth £180 million over eight years, which also included purchasing the naming rights for the Trafford Training Centre.[185]\\n\\nThe club\\'s first kit manufacturer was Umbro, until a five-year deal was agreed with Admiral Sportswear in 1975.[186] Adidas won the contract in 1980,[187] before Umbro started a second spell in 1992.[188] That sponsorship lasted for ten years, followed by Nike\\'s record-breaking £302.9 million deal, which lasted until 2015; 3.8 million replica shirts were sold in the first 22 months with the company.[189][190] In addition to Nike and Chevrolet, the club also has several lower-level \"platinum\" sponsors, including Aon and Budweiser.[191]\\n\\nOn 30 July 2012, United signed a seven-year deal with American automotive corporation General Motors, which replaced Aon as the shirt sponsor from the 2014–15 season. The new $80m-a-year shirt deal is worth $559m over seven years and features the logo of General Motors brand Chevrolet.[192][193] Nike announced that they would not renew their kit supply deal with Manchester United after the 2014–15 season, citing rising costs.[194][195] Since the start of the 2015–16 season, Adidas has manufactured Manchester United\\'s kit as part of a world-record 10-year deal worth a minimum of £750 million.[196][197] Plumbing products manufacturer Kohler became the club\\'s first sleeve sponsor ahead of the 2018–19 season.[198] Manchester United and General Motors did not renew their sponsorship deal, and the club subsequently signed a five-year, £235 million sponsorship deal with TeamViewer ahead of the 2021–22 season.[199] At the end of the 2023–24 season, TeamViewer were replaced by Snapdragon, who agreed a deal worth more than £60 million a year to take over as the club\\'s main sponsor.[200] In August 2024, Snapdragon\\'s parent company Qualcomm triggered an option to extend the deal by two years, taking it through to 2029.[201]\\n\\nOwnership and finances\\nOriginally funded by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, the club became a limited company in 1892 and sold shares to local supporters for £1 via an application form.[19] In 1902, majority ownership passed to the four local businessmen who invested £500 to save the club from bankruptcy, including future club president John Henry Davies.[19] After his death in 1927, the club faced bankruptcy yet again, but was saved in December 1931 by James W. Gibson, who assumed control of the club after an investment of £2,000.[24] Gibson promoted his son, Alan, to the board in 1948,[202] but died three years later; the Gibson family retained ownership of the club through James\\' wife, Lillian,[203] but the position of chairman passed to former player Harold Hardman.[204]\\n\\nPromoted to the board a few days after the Munich air disaster, Louis Edwards, a friend of Matt Busby, began acquiring shares in the club; for an investment of approximately £40,000, he accumulated a 54 per cent shareholding and took control in January 1964.[205] When Lillian Gibson died in January 1971, her shares passed to Alan Gibson who sold a percentage of his shares to Louis Edwards\\' son, Martin, in 1978; Martin Edwards went on to become chairman upon his father\\'s death in 1980.[206] Media tycoon Robert Maxwell attempted to buy the club in 1984, but did not meet Edwards\\' asking price.[206] In 1989, chairman Martin Edwards attempted to sell the club to Michael Knighton for £20 million, but the sale fell through and Knighton joined the board of directors instead.[206]\\n\\nManchester United was floated on the stock market in June 1991 (raising £6.7 million),[207] and received yet another takeover bid in 1998, this time from Rupert Murdoch\\'s British Sky Broadcasting Corporation. This resulted in the formation of Shareholders United Against Murdoch – now the Manchester United Supporters\\' Trust – who encouraged supporters to buy shares in the club in an attempt to block any hostile takeover. The Manchester United board accepted a £623 million offer,[208] but the takeover was blocked by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission at the final hurdle in April 1999.[209] A few years later, a power struggle emerged between the club\\'s manager, Alex Ferguson, and his horse-racing partners, John Magnier and J. P. McManus, who had gradually become the majority shareholders. In a dispute that stemmed from contested ownership of the horse Rock of Gibraltar, Magnier and McManus attempted to have Ferguson removed from his position as manager, and the board responded by approaching investors to attempt to reduce the Irishmen\\'s majority.[210]\\n\\nGlazer ownership\\nSee also: Glazer ownership of Manchester United\\nIn May 2005, Malcolm Glazer purchased the 28.7 per cent stake held by McManus and Magnier, thus acquiring a controlling interest through his investment vehicle Red Football Ltd in a highly leveraged takeover valuing the club at approximately £800 million (then approx. $1.5 billion).[211] Once the purchase was complete, the club was taken off the stock exchange.[212] Much of the takeover money was borrowed by the Glazers; the debts were transferred to the club. As a result, the club went from being debt-free to being saddled with debts of £540 million, at interest rates of between 7% and 20%.[15][213][214]\\n\\nIn July 2006, the club announced a £660 million debt refinancing package, resulting in a 30 per cent reduction in annual interest payments to £62 million a year.[215][216] In January 2010, with debts of £716.5 million ($1.17 billion),[217] Manchester United further refinanced through a bond issue worth £504 million, enabling them to pay off most of the £509 million owed to international banks.[218] The annual interest payable on the bonds – which were to mature on 1 February 2017 – is approximately £45 million per annum.[219] Despite restructuring, the club\\'s debt prompted protests from fans on 23 January 2010, at Old Trafford and the club\\'s Trafford Training Centre.[220][221] Supporter groups encouraged match-going fans to wear green and gold, the colours of Newton Heath. On 30 January, reports emerged that the Manchester United Supporters\\' Trust had held meetings with a group of wealthy fans, dubbed the \"Red Knights\", with plans to buying out the Glazers\\' controlling interest.[222] The club\\'s debts reached a high of £777 million in June 2007.[223]\\n\\nIn August 2011, the Glazers were believed to have approached Credit Suisse in preparation for a $1 billion (approx. £600 million) initial public offering (IPO) on the Singapore stock exchange that would value the club at more than £2 billion;[224] however, in July 2012, the club announced plans to list its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange instead.[225] Shares were originally set to go on sale for between $16 and $20 each, but the price was cut to $14 by the launch of the IPO on 10 August, following negative comments from Wall Street analysts and Facebook\\'s disappointing stock market debut in May. Even after the cut, Manchester United was valued at $2.3 billion, making it the most valuable football club in the world.[226]\\n\\nThe New York Stock Exchange allows for different shareholders to enjoy different voting rights over the club. Shares offered to the public (\"Class A\") had 10 times lesser voting rights than shares retained by the Glazers (\"Class B\").[227] Initially in 2012, only 10% of shares were offered to the public.[228] As of 2019, the Glazers retain ultimate control over the club, with over 70% of shares, and even higher voting power.[229]\\n\\nIn 2012, The Guardian estimated that the club had paid a total of over £500 million in debt interest and other fees on behalf of the Glazers,[230] and in 2019, reported that the total sum paid by the club for such fees had risen to £1 billion.[214] At the end of 2019, the club had a net debt of nearly £400 million.[231]\\n\\nIn 2023, the Glazers began soliciting bids for the sale of the club, and several bids were received. Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who owns Ineos, and Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, a Qatari sheikh, were the only bidders who had publicly declared their interest in a controlling share of the club.[232] In March 2023, Finnish entrepreneur Thomas Zilliacus also made his interest in Manchester United public.[233]\\n\\nOn 24 December 2023, it was announced that Ratcliffe had purchased 25 per cent of Manchester United, and that his Ineos Sport company was taking control of football operations.[234] Ratcliffe\\'s shareholdings increased to 28.94% in December 2024. The Glazers remain as majority shareholders.[235]\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'FC Bayern Munich': 'Fußball-Club Bayern München e. V. (FCB, German pronunciation: [ˈfuːsbalˌklʊp ˈbaɪɐn ˈmʏnçn̩]), commonly known as Bayern Munich (German: Bayern München), FC Bayern (pronounced [ˌɛft͡seː ˈbaɪɐn] ⓘ) or simply Bayern, is a German professional sports club based in Munich, Bavaria. They are most known for their men\\'s professional football team, who play in the Bundesliga, the top tier of the German football league system. Bayern are the most successful club in German football and are among the world\\'s most decorated, having won a record 33 national titles, including eleven consecutive titles from 2013 to 2023 and a record 20 national cups, alongside numerous European titles.\\n\\nBayern Munich was founded in 1900 by eleven players, led by Franz John.[4] Although Bayern won its first national championship in 1932, the club was not selected for the Bundesliga during its inception in 1963. The club found success in the mid-1970s when, under the captaincy of Franz Beckenbauer, they won the European Cup three consecutive times (1974–1976). Overall, Bayern have won six European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles (a German record), winning their sixth title in the 2020 final as part of the Treble, and it became the second European club to achieve this feat twice. Bayern has also won one UEFA Cup, one European Cup Winners\\' Cup, two UEFA Super Cups, two FIFA Club World Cups and two Intercontinental Cups, making it one of the most successful European clubs internationally, and the only German club to have won both international titles. Bayern players have accumulated five Ballon d\\'Or awards, two The Best FIFA Men\\'s Player awards, five European Golden Shoe and three UEFA Men\\'s Player of the Year awards, including UEFA Club Footballer of the Year.\\n\\nBy winning the 2020 FIFA Club World Cup, Bayern Munich became only the second club to win the \"sextuple\" (winning the League, Cup, and Champions League in one season followed by the Domestic Supercup, UEFA Supercup and Club World Cup in the next season), or all trophies that a club can win in a calendar year. Bayern Munich are one of five clubs to have won all three of UEFA\\'s main club competitions and the only German club to achieve that. As of November 2024, Bayern Munich are ranked third in UEFA club rankings. The club has traditional local rivalries with 1860 Munich and 1. FC Nürnberg.\\n\\nSince the beginning of the 2005–06 season, Bayern has played its home games at the Allianz Arena. Previously, the team had played at Munich\\'s Olympiastadion for 33 years. The team colours are red and white, and the crest shows the white and blue flag of Bavaria. Bayern Munich has the largest revenue out of any German sports club and the third highest-earning football club in the world, behind Barcelona and Real Madrid, earning €634.1 million in 2021.[5]\\n\\nBayern Munich is one of the most widely supported football clubs in the world,[6] and in April 2025, Bayern had more than 400,000 official club members and 4,147 officially registered fan clubs, with over 322,000 members, making the club the largest sports club in the world by membership.[7][8] The club has other departments for chess, handball, basketball, gymnastics, bowling, table tennis and senior football, with more than 1,100 active members.[9]\\n\\nHistory\\nMain article: History of FC Bayern Munich\\nEarly years (1900s–1960s)\\n\\nThe first game of Bayern Munich against 1. FC Nürnberg in 1901\\nBayern Munich was founded by members of a Munich gymnastics club (MTV 1879). When a congregation of members of MTV 1879 decided on 27 February 1900 that the footballers of the club would not be allowed to join the German Football Association (DFB), eleven members of the football division left the congregation and on the same evening founded Fußball-Club Bayern München. Within a few months, Bayern achieved high-scoring victories against all local rivals, including a 15–0 win against Nordstern,[10] and reached the semi-finals of the 1900–01 South German championship.[4] In the following years, the club won some local trophies, and, in 1910–11, Bayern joined the newly founded \"Kreisliga\", the first regional Bavarian league. The club won this league in its first year, but did not win it again until the beginning of the First World War in 1914, which halted all football activities in Germany.[11][12] By the end of its first decade of founding, Bayern had its first German national team player, Max Gablonsky.[13] By 1920, it had over 700 members, making it the largest football club in Munich.[13]\\n\\nIn the years after the war, Bayern won several regional competitions before winning its first South German championship in 1926, an achievement repeated two years later.[11][14] Its first national title was gained in 1932, when coach Richard \"Little Dombi\" Kohn led the team to the German championship by defeating Eintracht Frankfurt 2–0 in the final.[11]\\n\\nThe rise of Adolf Hitler to power put an abrupt end to Bayern\\'s development. Club president Kurt Landauer and the coach, both of whom were Jewish, left the country. Many others in the club were also purged. Bayern was taunted as the \"Jew\\'s club\", while local rival 1860 Munich gained much support. Josef Sauter, who was inaugurated in 1943, was the only NSDAP member as president. After a friendly match in Switzerland, some Bayern players greeted Landauer, who was a spectator, and the club was subject to continued discrimination.[15] Bayern was also affected by the ruling that football players had to be full amateurs again, which led to the move of gifted young centre-forward Oskar Rohr to Switzerland. In the following years, Bayern could not sustain its role of contender for the national title, achieving mid-table results in its regional league instead.[16]\\n\\nAfter the end of the Second World War in 1945, Bayern became a member of the Oberliga Süd, the southern conference of the German first division, which was split five ways at that time. Bayern struggled, hiring and firing 13 coaches between 1945 and 1963. Landauer returned from exile in 1947, and was once again appointed club president, the tenure lasted until 1951. He remains as the club\\'s president with the longest accumulated tenure. Landauer has been deemed the most important figure in Bayern\\'s transition to a professional club.[17][18] In 1955, the club was relegated but returned to the Oberliga in the following season and won the DFB-Pokal for the first time, beating Fortuna Düsseldorf 1–0 in the final.[19][20]\\n\\nThe club struggled financially, though, verging on bankruptcy at the end of the 1950s. President Reitlinger was ousted in the club\\'s elections of 1958 by the industrialist Roland Endler, who provided financial stability for the club. Under his reign, Bayern had its best years in the Oberliga.[21] Endler was no longer a candidate in 1962, when Wilhelm Neudecker, who became wealthy in the postwar construction boom, replaced him.\\n\\nIn 1963, the Oberligas in Germany were consolidated into one national league, the Bundesliga. Five teams from the Oberliga South were admitted. The key to qualifying for the Bundesliga was the accumulated record of the last twelve years, where Bayern was only the sixth-ranked club. To boot, local rivals 1860 Munich, ranked seventh, were champions of the last Oberliga-Süd season and were given preference on the basis of this achievement.[22][23] After initial protests by Bayern for alleged mistreatment remained fruitless, president Neudecker rose to the challenge and hired Zlatko Čajkovski, who in 1962 led 1. FC Köln to the national championship. Fielding a team with young players like Franz Beckenbauer, Gerd Müller and Sepp Maier – who would later be collectively referred to as the axis, they achieved promotion to the Bundesliga in 1965.[20]\\n\\nThe golden years (1960s–1970s)\\n\\nFranz Beckenbauer and Roberto Perfumo before a friendly v Argentina in 1970\\n\\nGerd Müller displayed on a 1973 football card\\nIn their first Bundesliga season, Bayern finished third and also won the DFB-Pokal. This qualified them for the following year\\'s European Cup Winners\\' Cup, which they won in the final against Scottish club Rangers, Franz Roth scoring the decider in a 1–0 extra time victory.[20] In 1967, Bayern retained the DFB-Pokal, but slow overall progress saw Branko Zebec take over as coach. He replaced Bayern\\'s offensive style of play with a more disciplined approach, and in doing so achieved the first league and cup double in Bundesliga history in 1969. Bayern Munich are one of five German clubs to win the Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal in the same season along with Borussia Dortmund, 1. FC Köln, Werder Bremen and Bayer Leverkusen. Zebec used only 13 players throughout the season.[24]\\n\\nUdo Lattek took charge in 1970. After winning the DFB-Pokal in his first season, Lattek led Bayern to their third German championship. The deciding match in the 1971–72 season against Schalke 04 was the first match in the new Olympiastadion, and was also the first live televised match in Bundesliga history. Bayern beat Schalke 5–1, so won the title, while also setting several records, including points gained and goals scored.[25] Bayern also won the next two championships, but the zenith was their triumph in the 1974 European Cup Final against Atlético Madrid, which Bayern won 4–0 after a replay.[26] This title – after winning the Cup Winners\\' trophy 1967 and two semi-finals (1968 and 1972) in that competition – marked the club\\'s breakthrough as a force on the international stage.\\n\\n\\nFC Bayern Munich against 1. FC Magdeburg in 1974\\nDuring the following years, the team was unsuccessful domestically, but defended their European title by defeating Leeds United in the 1975 European Cup final, when Roth and Müller secured victory with late goals. \"We came back into the game and scored two lucky goals, so in the end, we were the winners, but we were very, very lucky\", stated Franz Beckenbauer. Billy Bremner believed the French referee was \"very suspicious\". Leeds fans then rioted in Paris and were banned from European football for three years.[27] A year later in the final in Glasgow, another Roth goal helped defeat Saint-Étienne, and Bayern became the third club to win the trophy in three consecutive years. The final trophy won by Bayern in this era was the Intercontinental Cup, in which they defeated Brazilian club Cruzeiro over two legs.[28] The rest of the decade was a time of change and saw no further titles for Bayern. In 1977, Franz Beckenbauer left for New York Cosmos and, in 1979, Sepp Maier and Uli Hoeneß retired while Gerd Müller joined the Fort Lauderdale Strikers.[29] Bayerndusel was coined during this period as an expression of either contempt or envy about the sometimes narrow and last-minute wins against other teams.[citation needed]\\n\\nFrom FC Breitnigge to FC Hollywood (1970s–1990s)\\nThe 1980s were a period of off-field turmoil for Bayern, with many changes in personnel and financial problems. On the field, Paul Breitner and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, termed \"FC Breitnigge\", led the team to Bundesliga titles in 1980 and 1981. Apart from a DFB-Pokal win in 1982, two relatively unsuccessful seasons followed, after which Breitner retired, and former coach Udo Lattek returned. Bayern won the DFB-Pokal in 1984 and went on to win five Bundesliga championships in six seasons, including a double in 1986. European success, however, was elusive during the decade; Bayern, though, finished as runner-up in the European Cups of 1982 and 1987.[30]\\n\\nJupp Heynckes was hired as coach in 1987, but after two consecutive championships in 1988–89 and 1989–90, Bayern\\'s form dipped. After finishing second in 1990–91, the club finished just five points above the relegation places in 1991–92. In 1993–94, Bayern was eliminated in the UEFA Cup second round to Premier League side Norwich City, who were the only English club to beat Bayern at the Olympiastadion during Bayern\\'s time playing there.[31] Franz Beckenbauer took over for the second half of the 1993–94 season, winning the championship again after a four-year gap. Beckenbauer was then appointed club president.[32]\\n\\nHis successors as coach, Giovanni Trapattoni and Otto Rehhagel, both finished trophyless after a season, not meeting the club\\'s high expectations.[33] During this time, Bayern\\'s players frequently appeared in the gossip pages of the press rather than the sports pages, resulting in the nickname \"FC Hollywood\".[34] Franz Beckenbauer briefly returned at the end of the 1995–96 season as caretaker coach and led his team to victory in the UEFA Cup, beating Bordeaux in the final.[35] For the 1996–97 season, Trapattoni returned to win the championship. In the following season, Bayern lost the title to newly promoted Kaiserslautern and Trapattoni had to take his leave for the second time.[36][37]\\n\\nRenewed international success (1990s–2000s)\\n\\nThe Allianz Arena, opened in 2005, is one of the world\\'s most modern football stadiums.\\nAfter his success at Borussia Dortmund, Bayern were coached by Ottmar Hitzfeld from 1998 to 2004. In Hitzfeld\\'s first season, Bayern won the Bundesliga and came close to winning the Champions League, losing 2–1 to Manchester United into injury time after leading for most of the match.[38] The following year, in the club\\'s centenary season, Bayern won the third league and cup double in its history. A third consecutive Bundesliga title followed in 2001, won with a stoppage time goal on the final day of the league season.[39][40] Days later, Bayern won the Champions League for the fourth time after a 25-year gap, defeating Valencia on penalties.[41] The 2001–02 season began with a win in the Intercontinental Cup,[42] but ended trophyless otherwise. In 2002–03, Bayern won their fourth double, leading the league by a record margin of 16 points.[43] Hitzfeld\\'s reign ended in 2004, with Bayern underperforming, including defeat by second division Alemannia Aachen in the DFB-Pokal.[44]\\n\\nFelix Magath took over and led Bayern to two consecutive doubles. Prior to the start of the 2005–06 season, Bayern moved from the Olympiastadion to the new Allianz Arena, which the club shared with 1860 Munich.[45] On the field, their performance in 2006–07 was erratic. Trailing in the league and having lost to Alemannia Aachen in the cup yet again, coach Magath was sacked shortly after the winter break.[46]\\n\\nHitzfeld returned as a trainer in January 2007, but Bayern finished the 2006–07 season in fourth position, meaning no Champions League qualification for the first time in more than a decade. Additional losses in the DFB-Pokal and the DFB-Ligapokal left the club with no honours for the season.[citation needed]\\n\\nDomestic dominance and continental treble (2000s–2010s)\\nFor the 2007–08 season, Bayern made drastic squad changes to help rebuild.[47] Among new signings were 2006 World Cup players such as Franck Ribéry, Miroslav Klose and Luca Toni. Bayern won the Bundesliga in convincing fashion, leading the standings on every single week of play, and the DFB-Pokal against Borussia Dortmund.[48] After the season, Bayern\\'s long-term goalkeeper Oliver Kahn retired,[49] which left the club without a top-tier goalkeeper for several seasons. The club\\'s coach Ottmar Hitzfeld also retired and Jürgen Klinsmann was chosen as his successor.[50] However, Klinsmann was sacked before the end of his first season as Bayern trailed Wolfsburg in the league, had lost the quarterfinal of the DFB-Pokal to Bayer Leverkusen, and were defeated in the quarterfinal of the Champions League by Barcelona, conceding four goals in the first half of the first leg. Jupp Heynckes was named caretaker coach and led the club to a second-place finish in the league.[51]\\n\\n\\nBayern Munich playing against Bayer Leverkusen in the Bundesliga in September 2011\\nFor the 2009–10 season, Bayern hired Dutch manager Louis van Gaal,[52] and Dutch forward Arjen Robben joined Bayern.[53] Robben, alongside Ribéry, would go on to shape Bayern\\'s playstyle of attacking over the wings for the next ten years. The press quickly dubbed the duo \"Robbery\". In addition, David Alaba and Thomas Müller were promoted to the first team. Van Gaal stated: \"With me, Müller always plays\", which has become a much-referenced phrase over the years.[54] On the pitch, Bayern had its most successful season since 2001, securing the domestic double[55] and losing only in the final of the Champions League to Inter Milan.[56] Van Gaal was fired in April 2011 as Bayern was trailing in the league and eliminated in the first knockout round of the Champions League, again by Inter.[57]\\n\\nHeynckes returned for his second permanent spell in the 2011–12 season. Although the club had signed Manuel Neuer, ending Bayern\\'s quest for an adequate substitute for Kahn, and Jérôme Boateng for the season, Bayern remained without a title for a second consecutive season, coming in second to Borussia Dortmund in the league and the cup.[58] The Champions League final was held at the Allianz Arena and Bayern reached the final in their home stadium but lost to Chelsea on penalties.[59] Bayern Munich went on to win all titles in 2012–13. They set various Bundesliga records along the way,[60] becoming the first German team to win the treble. Bayern finished the Bundesliga on 91 points, only eleven points shy of a perfect season. In what was Bayern\\'s third Champions League final appearance within four years, they beat Borussia Dortmund 2–1.[61] A week later, they completed the treble by winning the DFB-Pokal final against Stuttgart.[62] During the season, the club announced that they would hire Pep Guardiola as coach for the 2013–14 season. Originally, the club presented this as Heynckes retiring on the expiration of his contract, but Uli Hoeneß later admitted that it was not Heynckes\\'s decision to leave Bayern at the end of the season. It was actually forced by the club\\'s desire to appoint Guardiola.[63]\\n\\nGuardiola\\'s first season started off well, with Bayern extending a streak of undefeated league matches from the previous season to 53 matches. An eventual loss to Augsburg came two match days after Bayern had won the league title.[64] During the season, Bayern had also claimed two other titles, the FIFA Club World Cup and the UEFA Super Cup,[65][66] the latter being the last major trophy the club had not yet won. Bayern also won the cup to complete their tenth domestic double,[67] but lost in the semi-final of the Champions League to Real Madrid.[68] Off the pitch, Bayern\\'s president Uli Hoeneß was convicted of tax evasion in March 2014, and sentenced to 3+1⁄2 years in prison. Hoeneß resigned the next day,[69] and vice-president Karl Hopfner was elected president in May.[70] Under Guardiola, Bayern also won the Bundesliga in 2014–15 and 2015–16, including another double in 2015–16,[71] but did not advance past the semi-finals in the Champions League. Although the club\\'s leadership tried to convince Guardiola to stay, the coach decided not to extend his three-year contract.[72]\\n\\nCarlo Ancelotti was hired as successor to Guardiola.[73] Off the pitch, Uli Hoeneß had been released early from prison and reelected as president in November 2016.[74] Under Ancelotti, Bayern won a fifth consecutive league title.[75] In July 2017, Bayern announced that 1860 Munich would leave the Allianz Arena for good as the club had been relegated to the fourth-tier Regionalliga.[76] During the 2017–18 season, Bayern\\'s performances were perceived to be increasingly lacklustre, and Ancelotti was sacked after a 3–0 loss to Paris St. Germain in the Champions League, early in his second season.[77] Willy Sagnol took over as interim manager for a week, before Jupp Heynckes was announced as coach for the rest of the season, in what was his fourth spell at the club.[78] During the season, the club urged Heynckes—even publicly—to extend his contract, but Heynckes, aged 73, stayed firm that he would retire after the season.[79] Heynckes led the club to another championship, but lost the cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt. Eintracht\\'s coach, Niko Kovač, was named Heynckes\\' successor at Bayern.[80] In Kovač\\'s first season at Bayern, the club was eliminated by Liverpool in the round of 16 in the Champions League, the first time since 2011 that Bayern did not reach the quarter-final.[81] Bayern won their seventh straight Bundesliga title, however, as they finished two points above Dortmund with 78 points. This Bundesliga title was Ribéry\\'s ninth and Robben\\'s eighth.[82] A week later, Bayern defeated RB Leipzig 3–0 in the 2019 DFB-Pokal final to win their 19th German Cup and to complete their 12th domestic double.[83]\\n\\nReturn to German coaches (2019–2024)\\nKovač was sacked after a 5–1 loss to Eintracht Frankfurt, with Hansi Flick being promoted to interim manager in November 2019.[84][85] After a satisfying spell as interim, Bayern announced a month later that Flick would remain in charge.[86] Under Flick, the club won the league, having played the most successful second half of a Bundesliga season in history, winning all but one match, which was drawn.[87] The club also won the cup, completing the club\\'s 13th domestic double.[88] In the Champions League, Bayern reached their first final since 2013, having beaten Barcelona 8–2 in the quarter-finals.[89] Bayern defeated Paris Saint-Germain 1–0 in the final, which was held in Lisbon behind closed doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Former PSG player Kingsley Coman scored the only goal of the match.[90] Bayern became the second European club after Barcelona to complete the seasonal treble in two different seasons.[91]\\n\\nBayern started the 2020–21 season by winning the UEFA Super Cup for the second time in their history. Bayern also won the FIFA Club World Cup, defeating Mexican team Tigres 1–0 in the final. Bayern became the second club to win the sextuple, after Barcelona did so in 2009.[92] The club also won its ninth Bundesliga title in a row.[93] During the season, Robert Lewandowski broke Gerd Müller\\'s record for most goals scored in a Bundesliga season, having scored 41 times in 29 matches.[94] Flick left at the end of the 2020–21 season to manage the Germany national team, and at Flick\\'s request, RB Leipzig manager Julian Nagelsmann succeeded him.[95][96] According to several news reports, Bayern paid Leipzig €25m as compensation for Nagelsmann\\'s services, a world record for a manager.[97]\\n\\nUnder Nagelsmann, Bayern won its 10th consecutive Bundesliga title.[98] In March 2023, Nagelsmann was released by Bayern and replaced with Thomas Tuchel,[99] who led the club to a record eleventh consecutive title, after winning a close title race with Borussia Dortmund.[100] In August 2023, Bayern broke the German transfer record again, signing England captain and all-time leading goalscorer Harry Kane from Tottenham Hotspur for a reported fee of €110m.[101] In February 2024, Bayern and Tuchel announced the end of their cooperation after the end of the season. The 2023–24 Bundesliga was the first season in a decade Bayern Munich did not win the Bundesliga, losing it to Bayer Leverkusen.[102]\\n\\nOn 29 May 2024, Vincent Kompany was confirmed as the new head coach of Bayern and received a three-year contract.[103] Bayern started the 2024–25 Bundesliga season with a 3–2 win at VfL Wolfsburg.[104]\\n\\nKits\\n\\nWikimedia Commons has media related to FC Bayern München kits (1900–2000).\\n\\nWikimedia Commons has media related to FC Bayern München kits (2000–present).\\nIn the original club constitution, Bayern\\'s colours were named as white and blue, but the club played in white shirts with black shorts until 1905 when Bayern joined MSC. MSC decreed that the footballers would have to play in red shorts. Also, the younger players were called red shorts, which were meant as an insult.[4] For most of the club\\'s early history, Bayern had primarily worn white and maroon home kits. In 1968–69 season, Bayern changed to red and blue striped shirts, with blue shorts and socks. Between 1969 and 1973, the team wore a home strip of red and white striped shirts with either red or white shorts and red socks. In the 1973–74 season, the team switched to an all-white kit featuring single vertical red and blue stripes on the shirt. From 1974 onwards, Bayern has mostly worn an all-red home kit with white trim. Bayern revived the red and blue striped colour scheme between 1995 and 1997. In 1997, blue was the dominant colour for the first time when Adidas released an all navy blue home kit with a red chest band. In 1999, Bayern returned to a predominantly red kit, which featured blue sleeves, and, in 2000, the club released a traditional all-red kit with white trim to be worn for Champions League matches.[105] Bayern also wore a Rotwein-coloured home kit in Bundesliga matches between 2001 and 2003, and during the 2006–07 Champions League campaign, in reference to their first-choice colours prior to the late 1960s.[106]\\n\\nThe club\\'s away kit has had a wide range of colours, including white, black, blue, and gold-green. Bayern also features a distinct international kit. During the 2013–14 season, Bayern used an all-red home kit with a Bavarian flag diamond watermark pattern, a Lederhosen-inspired white and black Oktoberfest away kit, and an all-navy blue international kit.[107]\\n\\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Bayern used a special away kit when playing at Kaiserslautern, representing the Brazilian colours blue and yellow, a superstition borne from the fact that the club found it hard to win there.[108][failed verification]\\n\\nKit suppliers and shirt sponsors\\nPeriod\\tKit manufacturer\\tShirt sponsor (chest)\\tShirt sponsor (sleeve)\\n1964–1971\\tPalme Trikotfabrik[109]\\tNone\\tNone\\n1971–1974\\tErima\\n1974–1978\\tAdidas\\tAdidas\\n1978–1981\\tMagirus Deutz\\n1981–1984\\tIveco Magirus\\n1984–1989\\tCommodore\\n1989–2002\\tOpel\\n2002–2017\\tDeutsche Telekom\\n2017–2018\\tHamad Airport\\n2018–2023\\tQatar Airways\\n2023–2024\\tAudi\\n2024–present\\tAllianz\\nKit deals\\nKit supplier\\tPeriod\\tLatest contract\\nannouncement\\tCurrent contract\\nduration\\tValue\\tNotes\\nAdidas\\t1974–present\\t28 April 2015\\t2015–2030 (15 years)\\tTotal €900 million\\n(€60 million per year)\\t[110][111]\\nCrest\\n\\nFlag of Bavaria\\nBayern\\'s crest has changed several times. Originally it consisted of the stylised letters F, C, B, M, which were woven into one symbol. The original crest was blue. The colours of Bavaria were included for the first time in 1954.[105] The crest from 1919 to 1924 denotes \"Bayern FA\", whereby \"FA\" stands for Fußball-Abteilung, i.e., Football Department; Bayern then was integrated into TSV Jahn Munich and constituted its football department.[citation needed]\\n\\nThe modern version of the crest has changed from the 1954 version in several steps.[105] While the crest consisted of a single colour only for most of the time, namely blue or red, the current crest is blue, red, and white. It has the colours of Bavaria in its centre, and FC Bayern München is written in white on a red ring enclosing the Bavarian colours.\\n\\n\\nModel of Bayern\\'s first stadium, their home from 1906 to 1924\\nBayern played its first training games at the Schyrenplatz in the centre of Munich. The first official games were held on the Theresienwiese. In 1901, Bayern moved to a field of its own, located in Schwabing at the Clemensstraße. After joining the Münchner Sport-Club (MSC) in 1906, Bayern moved in May 1907 to MSC\\'s ground at the Leopoldstraße.[113] As the crowds gathering for Bayern\\'s home games increased at the beginning of the 1920s, Bayern had to switch to various other premises in Munich.[114]\\n\\nFrom 1925, Bayern shared the Grünwalder Stadion with 1860 Munich.[115] Until the Second World War, the stadium was owned by 1860 Munich, and is still colloquially known as Sechz\\'ger (\"Sixties\") Stadium. It was destroyed during the war, and efforts to rebuild it resulted in a patchwork. Bayern\\'s record crowd at the Grünwalder Stadion is reported as more than 50,000 in the home game against 1. FC Nürnberg in the 1961–62 season.[116] In the Bundesliga era, the stadium had a maximum capacity of 44,000, which was reached on several occasions, but the capacity has since been reduced to 21,272. As was the case at most of this period\\'s stadiums, the vast majority of the stadium was given over to terracing. Since 1995, the second teams and youth teams of both clubs played in the stadium.[117][118]\\n\\n\\nThe Olympiastadion, home of Bayern Munich from 1972 to 2005\\nFor the 1972 Summer Olympics, the city of Munich built the Olympiastadion. The stadium, renowned for its architecture,[119] was inaugurated in the last Bundesliga match of the 1971–72 season. The match drew a capacity crowd of 79,000, a total which was reached again on numerous occasions. In its early days, the stadium was considered one of the foremost stadiums in the world, and played host to numerous major finals, such as that of the 1974 FIFA World Cup.[120] In the following years, the stadium underwent several modifications, such as an increase in seating space from approximately 50 per cent to 66 per cent. Eventually, the stadium had a capacity of 63,000 for national matches and 59,000 for international occasions such as European Cup competitions. Many people, however, began to feel that the stadium was too cold in winter, with half the audience exposed to the weather due to lack of cover. A further complaint was the distance between the spectators and the pitch, betraying the stadium\\'s track and field heritage. Renovation proved impossible, as the architect Günther Behnisch vetoed major modifications of the stadium.[121]\\n\\n\\nAllianz Arena is lit in red for Bayern home games.\\nAfter much discussion, the city of Munich, the state of Bavaria, Bayern Munich and 1860 Munich jointly decided at the end of 2000 to build a new stadium. While Bayern had wanted a purpose-built football stadium for several years, the awarding of the 2006 FIFA World Cup to Germany stimulated the discussion as the Olympiastadion no longer met the FIFA criteria to host a World Cup game. Located on the northern outskirts of Munich, the Allianz Arena has been in use since the beginning of the 2005–06 season.[121] Since August 2012, 2,000 more seats were added in the last row of the top tier, increasing the capacity to 71,000.[122] In January 2015, a proposal to increase the capacity was approved by the city council, with the Allianz Arena holding a capacity of 75,000 (70,000 in Champions League).[123]\\n\\nThe stadium\\'s most prominent feature is the translucent outer layer, which can be illuminated in different colours for effects. Red lighting is used for Bayern home games and white for Germany national team home games.[124]\\n\\nIn May 2012, Bayern opened a museum about its history, FC Bayern Erlebniswelt, inside the Allianz Arena.[125]\\n\\nSupporters\\n\\nA part of the \"Südkurve\" – the usual spot of the ultra-scene at Allianz Arena\\nAt the 2018 annual general meeting, the Bayern board reported that the club had 291,000 official members and 4,433 officially registered fan clubs with over 390,000 members.[126] This made the club the largest fan membership club in the world.[127] Bayern has an average of 75,000 fans at the Allianz Arena which is at 100 per cent capacity level. Every Bundesliga game has been sold-out for years.[128] Bayern\\'s away games have also been sold out for many years.[129] According to a study by Sport+Markt from 2010, Bayern is the fifth-most popular football club in Europe with 20.7 million supporters, ranking first of all German clubs.[130]\\n\\nThe club\\'s most prominent ultra groups are Schickeria München, Inferno Bavaria, Red Munichs \\'89, Südkurve \\'73, Munichmaniacs 1996, Red Angels, and Red Sharks. The ultras scene of Bayern Munch has been recognised for certain groups taking stance against right-wing extremism, racism and homophobia,[131][132][133] and in 2014 the group Schickeria München received the Julius Hirsch Award by the DFB for its commitment against antisemitism and discrimination.[134][135][136][137]\\n\\nStern des Südens is the song which fans sing at FCB home games. In the 1990s, they also used to sing FC Bayern, Forever Number One.[138] Another notable song is Mia San Mia[b] (Bavarian for \"we are who we are\"), which is a well-known motto of the club as well.[140] A renowned catchphrase for the team is \"Packmas\", which is a Bavarian phrase for the German \"Packen wir es\", which means \"let\\'s do it\".[141] The club\\'s mascot is an anthropomorphic bear named \"Berni\" since 2004.[142]\\n\\nThe club also has had a number of high-profile supporters, among them Pope Benedict XVI,[143] Boris Becker, Wladimir Klitschko, Horst Seehofer and Edmund Stoiber, former Minister-President of Bavaria.[144]\\n\\nRivalries\\nMain articles: Der Klassiker, Munich derby, and Bavarian football derbies\\n\\nA Munich derby match at the Allianz Arena between Bayern and 1860 Munich in the quarter-final of the 2007–08 DFB-Pokal on 27 February 2008\\nBorussia Dortmund\\nBayern–Dortmund are two of the most successful teams in German football, having won a combined total of 26 of the past 31 Bundesliga titles as of the 2023–24 season. The two teams fought closely for the Bundesliga title in the early 2010s, and met in the 2013 UEFA Champions League final. The rivalry between the clubs grew during the 1990s, as Dortmund\\'s stature increased to challenge perennial title favourites Bayern, winning two Bundesliga titles in 1994–95 and 1995–96.\\n\\nIn 1996, Bayern captain Lothar Matthäus accused Germany teammate Andreas Möller of being a \\'crybaby\\', wiping imaginary tears from his face; Möller reacted by slapping Matthäus. At the end of that season, Dortmund won the 1997 UEFA Champions League final which happened to be played at the Olympiastadion, Bayern\\'s home ground.\\n\\nThe teams met in the quarter-finals of the next edition of the Champions League, and Dortmund prevailed over two legs thanks to a single goal from Stéphane Chapuisat. That summer, Bayern hired Dortmund\\'s successful coach Ottmar Hitzfeld to work for them. Tempers flared twice during Bayern and Dortmund\\'s second meeting in the 1998–99 Bundesliga, as Bayern goalkeeper Oliver Kahn first attempted a flying kung-fu kick at Chapuisat, and later appeared to bite Heiko Herrlich\\'s ear.\\n\\nIn the early 2000s both clubs remained successful, as Bayern lost one Champions League final (1999) then won another (2001) in addition to more domestic success, while Dortmund won the 2001–02 Bundesliga and reached the UEFA Cup final the same year. An angry 2001 league meeting between the pair was notable for ten yellow cards and three red being shown (a Bundesliga record for indiscipline). However, Dortmund soon fell heavily into debt, and a €2m loan from Bayern in 2004 was a major reason for them being saved from bankruptcy.\\n\\nOn 19 April 2008, the two sides clashed in the 2008 DFB-Pokal final for the first time that took place in Berlin. Luca Toni opened the scoring after eleven minutes, but Mladen Petric drew Dortmund level in stoppage time, forcing thirty additional minutes. The Italian completed his double in extra time, thus lifting Bayern to cup glory.\\n\\nEuropean Rivals\\n\\nBayern Munich won 2–1 against Borussia Dortmund to win the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League on 25 May 2013.\\nAmongst Bayern\\'s chief European rivals are FC Barcelona,[145] Real Madrid,[146] AC Milan,[147] and Manchester United.[148] Real Madrid versus Bayern is the match that has historically been played most often in the Champions League/European Cup with 28 matches. Due to Bayern being traditionally hard to beat for Madrid, Madrid supporters often refer to Bayern as the \"Bestia negra\" (\"Black Beast\").[149] Despite the number of duels, Bayern and Real have never met in the final of a Champions League or European Cup.\\n\\nOrganization and finance\\n\\nBayern\\'s former president from 1994 to 2009 and former player Franz Beckenbauer\\nSee also: Forbes list of the most valuable sports teams\\nBayern is mostly led by former club players. From 2016 to 2019, Uli Hoeneß served as the club\\'s president, following Karl Hopfner who had been in office from 2014; Hoeneß had resigned in 2014 after being convicted of tax fraud.[150][151] Oliver Kahn was chairman of the executive board of the AG.[152] The supervisory board of nine consists mostly of managers of big German corporations. Besides the club\\'s president and the board\\'s chairman, they are Herbert Hainer former CEO of (Adidas), Dr. Herbert Diess chairman of (Volkswagen), Dr. Werner Zedelius senior advisor at (Allianz), Timotheus Höttges CEO of (Deutsche Telekom), Dieter Mayer, Edmund Stoiber, Theodor Weimer CEO of (Deutsche Börse), and Dr. Michael Diederich speaker of the board at (UniCredit Bank).[153][154]\\n\\nProfessional football at Bayern is run by the spin-off organisation FC Bayern München AG. AG is short for Aktiengesellschaft, and Bayern is run like a joint stock company, a company whose stock are not listed on the public stock exchange, but is privately owned. 75 per cent of FC Bayern München AG is owned by the club, the FC Bayern München e. V. (e. V. is short for eingetragener Verein, which translates into \"registered association\"). Three German corporations, the sports goods manufacturer Adidas, the automobile company Audi and the financial services group Allianz each hold 8.33 per cent of the shares, 25 per cent in total.[152] Adidas acquired its shares in 2002 for €77 million. The money was designated to help finance the Allianz Arena.[155] In 2009, Audi paid €90 million for their share. The capital was used to repay the loan on the Allianz Arena.[156] And in early 2014, Allianz became the third shareholder of the company acquiring theirs share for €110 million. With the sale, Bayern paid off the remaining debt on the Allianz Arena 16 years ahead of schedule.[157] Bayern\\'s other sports departments are run by the club.[citation needed]\\n\\n\\nThe Bayern Munich team bus provided by sponsor MAN\\nBayern\\'s shirt sponsor is Deutsche Telekom. Deutsche Telekom has been Bayern\\'s shirt sponsor since the start of 2002–03 season. The company extended their sponsorship deal in August 2015 until the end of the 2026–27 season.[158] Previous kit sponsors were Adidas[159] (1974–78), Magirus Deutz and Iveco[160] (1978–84), Commodore[161] (1984–89) and Opel[162] (1989–2002). Bayern\\'s kit manufacturer is Adidas, who have been Bayern\\'s kit manufacturer since 1974. The deal with Adidas runs until the end of the 2029–30 season.[163]\\n\\nBayern is an exception in professional football, having generated profits for 27 consecutive years.[126] Other clubs often report losses, realising transfers via loans, whereas Bayern always uses current assets. In the 2019 edition of the Deloitte Football Money League, Bayern had the fourth-highest revenue in club football, generating revenue of €629.2 million. Bayern had the second-highest commercial revenue in the 2019 Deloitte Football Money League, behind only Real Madrid. Bayern\\'s commercial revenue was €348.7 million (55 per cent of total revenue). In contrast, Bayern\\'s matchday revenue trails other top clubs at €103.8 million (17 per cent of their total revenue).[164] In 2017, Forbes ranks Bayern as the world\\'s fourth-most valuable football club in their annual list, estimating the club\\'s value at €2.5 billion.[165]\\n\\nWhile other European clubs have mainly marketed to international audiences, Bayern had focused on Germany.[166] Since the 2010s, Bayern have started to focus their marketing more on Asia and the United States. Bayern made summer tours to the United States in 2014 and 2016.[citation needed] Bayern went to China in the summer of 2015 and returned in the summer of 2017, where they also played games in Singapore. In August 2014, Bayern opened an office in New York City as the club wants to strengthen their brand positioning against other top European clubs in the United States.[167] In March 2017, Bayern opened an office in Shanghai, China.[168]\\n\\nSocial engagement and charity\\nBayern has been involved with charitable ventures for a long time, helping other football clubs in financial disarray as well as ordinary people in misery.

V.\" was founded, a foundation that aims to concentrate the social engagements of the club.[169] At its inception, this venture was funded with €600,000, raised by officials and players of the club.[170] The money was, amongst other things, used to build a school in Marathenkerny, Sri Lanka,[170] and to rebuild the area of Trincomalee, Sri Lanka.[169]\\n\\nThe club has also assisted other sport clubs in financial disarray. The club has supported its local rival 1860 Munich with player transfers at favourable rates and direct money transfers.[171] When St. Pauli threatened to lose its licence for professional football due to financial problems,[when?] Bayern met the club for a friendly game, giving all gate receipts to St. Pauli.[172] In 1993, Alexander Zickler transferred from Dynamo Dresden to Bayern for 2.3 Million DM, with many considering the sum to have been a subvention for the financially threatened Dresdeners.[173] In 2003, Bayern provided a €2 Million loan to the nearly bankrupt Borussia Dortmund.[174][175][176] In 2009, Mark van Bommel\\'s home club Fortuna Sittard was in financial distress; Bayern played a charity game at the Dutch club, gifting them gate receipts.[177] In 2013, Bayern played a charity game against financially threatened third division side Hansa Rostock. The game raised about €1 million, securing Hansa\\'s licence.[178] In 2017, Bayern played a benefit match against financial troubled Kickers Offenbach, with all gate receipts going to Kickers Offenbach.[179] Two years later, Bayern played a benefit match against Kaiserslautern. The match was played so Kaiserslautern could secure their licence to play in the German third division. All income from the match went to Kaiserslautern.[180] In March 2020, Bayern, Borussia Dortmund, RB Leipzig and Bayer Leverkusen, the four German UEFA Champions League teams for the 2019–20 season, collectively gave €20 million to Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga teams that were struggling financially during the COVID-19 pandemic.[181]\\n\\nIn mid-2013, Bayern was the first club to give financial support to the Magnus Hirschfeld National Foundation. The foundation researches the living environment LGBT people, and developed an education concept to facilitate unbiased dealing with LGBT themes in football.[182] In 2016, Bayern received the Nine Values Cup, an award of the international children\\'s social programme Football for Friendship.[183]\\n\\nTraining facility\\n\\nEntrance of Bayern Munich Headquarters\\nBayern Munich headquarters and training facility is called Säbener Straße and it is located in the Untergiesing-Harlaching borough of Munich. The first team and the reserve team train at the facility.[184] There are five grass pitches, two of which have undersoil heating, two artificial grass fields, a beach volleyball court and a multi-functional sports hall.[185]\\n\\nIn August 2017, the club\\'s sports complex, FC Bayern Campus, opened at a cost of €70 million.[186] The campus is located north of Munich at Ingolstädter Straße. The campus is 30 hectare and has eight football pitches for youth teams from the U-9s to the U-19s and the women\\'s and girls\\' teams. The campus also has a 2,500-capacity stadium where the U-17s and the U-19s play their matches. The Allianz Bayern Akademie is located on the campus site, and the academy has 35 apartments for young talents who do not live in the Greater Munich area. The academy building also has offices for youth coaches and staff.[187]\\n\\nHonours\\nMain article: List of FC Bayern Munich records and statistics § Honours\\nBayern is historically the most successful team in German football, as they have won the most championships and the most cups. They are also Germany\\'s most successful team in international competitions, having won fourteen trophies. Bayern is the only club to have won all three major European competitions, to have won three consecutive European Cups and to have won the treble twice, one of which was part of the larger, and more elusive, \"sextuple\" (2020).',\n",
       " 'Arsenal F.C.': 'The Arsenal Football Club, commonly known as simply Arsenal, is a professional football club based in Islington, North London, England. They compete in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. In domestic football, Arsenal have won 13 league titles (including one unbeaten title), a record 14 FA Cups, 2 League Cups, 17 FA Community Shields, and a Football League Centenary Trophy. In European football, they have one European Cup Winners\\' Cup and one Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. In terms of trophies won, it is the third-most successful club in English football.[2]\\n\\nArsenal was the first club from southern England to join the Football League in 1893, and it reached the First Division in 1904. Relegated only once, in 1913, it continues the longest streak in the top division,[3] and has won the second-most top-flight matches in English football history.[4] In the 1930s, Arsenal won five League Championships and two FA Cups, and another FA Cup and two Championships after the war. In 1970–71, it won its first League and FA Cup double. Between 1989 and 2005, they won five league titles and five FA Cups, including two more doubles. They completed the 20th century with the highest average league position.[5] Between 1998 and 2017, Arsenal qualified for the UEFA Champions League for an English football record nineteen consecutive seasons.[6]\\n\\nIn 1886, munitions workers at the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich founded the club as Dial Square. In 1913, the club crossed the city to Arsenal Stadium in Highbury, becoming close neighbours of Tottenham Hotspur, and creating the North London derby. Herbert Chapman won the club its first silverware, and his legacy enabled a trophy-laden period in the 1930s. He helped introduce the WM formation, floodlights, and shirt numbers;[7] he also added the white sleeves and brighter red to the club\\'s jersey.[8] Arsène Wenger is the club\\'s longest-serving manager and has won the most trophies. He won a record seven FA Cups, and his third and final title-winning team set an English record for the longest top-flight unbeaten league run at 49 games between 2003 and 2004, receiving the nickname The Invincibles.\\n\\nIn 2006, the club moved to the nearby Emirates Stadium. With an annual revenue of £367.1m in the 2021–22 season,[9] Arsenal was estimated to be worth US$2.26 billion by Forbes, making it the world\\'s tenth-most valuable football club,[10] while it is one of the most followed on social media.[11] The motto of the club is Victoria Concordia Crescit, Latin for \"Victory Through Harmony\".\\n\\nHistory\\nFurther information: History of Arsenal F.C. (1886–1966), History of Arsenal F.C. (1966–present), and Arsenal Football Club Museum\\n1886–1912: Dial Square to Royal Arsenal\\n\\nRoyal Arsenal squad in 1888. Original captain David Danskin sits on the right of the bench.\\nIn October 1886, Scotsman David Danskin and fifteen fellow munitions workers in Woolwich formed Dial Square Football Club, named after a workshop at the heart of the Royal Arsenal complex. Each member contributed sixpence, and Danskin also added three shillings to help form the club.[12][note 1] Dial Square played their first match on 11 December 1886 against the Eastern Wanderers and won 6–0. The club had been renamed Royal Arsenal by January 1887,[15][16] and its first home was Plumstead Common,[15] though they spent most of their time playing at the Manor Ground. Their first trophies were the Kent Senior Cup and London Charity Cup in 1889–90 and the London Senior Cup in 1890–91; these were the only county association trophies Arsenal won during their time in South East London.[17][18] In 1891, Royal Arsenal became the first London club to turn professional.[19]\\n\\nRoyal Arsenal was renamed for the second time upon becoming a limited liability company in 1893. They registered their new name, Woolwich Arsenal, with the Football League when the club ascended later that year.[20][21]:\\u200a5–21\\u200a Woolwich Arsenal was the first southern member of the Football League, starting out in the Second Division and reaching the First Division in 1904. Falling attendances, due to financial difficulties among the munitions workers and the arrival of more accessible football clubs elsewhere in the city, led the club close to bankruptcy by 1910.[22][21]:\\u200a112–149\\u200a Businessmen Henry Norris and William Hall became involved in the club, and sought to move them elsewhere.[23][21]:\\u200a22–42\\u200a\\n\\n\\n1912–1925: Bank of England club\\nIn 1913, soon after relegation back to the Second Division, the club moved across the river to the new Arsenal Stadium in Highbury.[24][25][26] In 1919, the Football League controversially voted to promote The Arsenal, instead of relegated local rivals Tottenham Hotspur, into the newly enlarged First Division, despite only finishing fifth in the Second Division\\'s last pre-war season of 1914–15. Later that year, The Arsenal started dropping \"The\" in official documents, gradually shifting its name for the final time towards Arsenal, as it is generally known today.[27]\\n\\n\\nA bronze bust of Herbert Chapman stands inside the Emirates Stadium.\\nWith a new home and First Division football, attendances were more than double those at the Manor Ground, and Arsenal\\'s budget grew rapidly.[28][29] With record-breaking spending and gate receipts, Arsenal quickly became known as the Bank of England club.[30][31]\\n\\n1925–1934: Herbert Chapman\\'s legendary Gunners\\nArsenal\\'s location and record-breaking salary offer lured star Huddersfield Town manager Herbert Chapman in 1925.[32][33] Over the next five years, Chapman built a revolutionary new Arsenal. Firstly, he appointed an enduring new trainer, Tom Whittaker who would one day rise to become a fabled Arsenal manager himself.[34] With the help of player Charlie Buchan, implemented the nascent WM formation which would serve as a stable bedrock to his outfit.[35][36] He also captured generational young talents such as Cliff Bastin and Eddie Hapgood, whilst also lavishing Highbury\\'s high income on stars such as David Jack and Alex James.\\n\\nTransformed, Chapman\\'s Arsenal claimed their first national trophy, the FA Cup in 1930, and League Championships followed in 1930–31 and 1932–33.[37] Chapman also presided over off-pitch changes: white sleeves and shirt numbers were added to the kit;[note 2] a Tube station was named after the club;[41][42] and the first of two opulent Art Deco stands was completed, with some of the first floodlights in English football.[29] Suddenly, in the middle of the 1933–34 season, Chapman died of pneumonia.[43]\\n\\n1934–1947: Shaw, Allison and the Second World War\\nChapman\\'s death meant work was left to his colleagues Joe Shaw and George Allison, with both proving to be shrewd and consummate custodians of Chapman\\'s excellent Arsenal team, seeing out a hat-trick of league wins with the 1933–34, 1934–35, and 1937–38 titles, and then furthermore winning the 1936 FA Cup.[44][45]\\n\\nWorld War II meant the Football League was suspended for seven years. While Arsenal were paraded by the nation as a symbol of solidarity with war efforts, the war took a huge toll on the team as the club had had more players killed than any top flight club.[46] Furthermore, debt from reconstructing an ambitious North Bank Stand redevelopment greatly bled Arsenal\\'s resources.[47][29]\\n\\n1947–1962: Tom Whittaker\\'s meteoric Gunners\\nDespite this period of turbulence and churn, Arsenal returned to win the league in the second post-war season of 1947–48. This was Tom Whittaker\\'s first season as manager, and meant the club equalled the champions of England record.[3] Whittaker, despite his disarming humble and modest disposition, was oft-referred to as the \"brains\" behind charismatic Chapman\\'s legendary Arsenal side.[48][49] He gathered a successful and highly skilled Arsenal side in spite of greatly limited resources, with a fiery and expansive style that drove great fanfare at the time.[50]\\n\\nThey won a third FA Cup in 1950, and then won a record-breaking seventh championship in 1952–53 making Arsenal the most successful team in English history at the time.[51][52]\\n\\n1962–1984: Billy Wright, Bertie Mee and Terry Neill\\'s cohorts\\n\\nAlan Ball (left) and Bertie Mee (who led Arsenal to their first double in 1971), pictured in 1972\\nArsenal were not to win the League or the FA Cup for another 18 years. The \\'53 Champions squad had aged, and the club failed to attract strong enough replacements.[53] Although Arsenal were competitive during these years, their fortunes had waned; the club spent most of the 1950s and 1960s in mid-table mediocrity.[54] Even former England captain Billy Wright could not bring the club any success as manager, in a stint between 1962 and 1966.[55]\\n\\nArsenal tentatively appointed club physiotherapist Bertie Mee as acting manager in 1966.[56][57] With new assistant Don Howe and new players such as Bob McNab and George Graham, Mee led Arsenal to their first League Cup finals, in 1967–68 and 1968–69. Next season saw a breakthrough, with Arsenal\\'s first competitive European trophy, the 1969–70 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. The season after, Arsenal achieved an even greater triumph with their first League and FA Cup double, and a new champions of England record.[58] This marked a premature high point of the decade; the Double-winning side was soon broken up and the rest of the decade was characterised by a series of near misses, with Arsenal finishing as FA Cup runners up in 1972, and First Division runners-up in 1972–73.[57]\\n\\nFormer player Terry Neill succeeded Mee in 1976. At the age of 34, he became the youngest Arsenal manager to date.[59] With new signings like Malcolm Macdonald and Pat Jennings, and a crop of talent in the side like Liam Brady and Frank Stapleton, the club reached a trio of FA Cup finals (1978 FA Cup, 1979 FA Cup and 1980 FA Cup), and lost the 1980 European Cup Winners\\' Cup Final on penalties. The club\\'s only trophy during this time was the 1979 FA Cup, achieved with a last-minute 3–2 victory over Manchester United, in a final is widely regarded as a classic.[60][61]\\n\\n1984–1996: George Graham\\'s Arsenal\\n\\nTony Adams statue outside the Emirates Stadium\\nOne of Mee\\'s double winners, George Graham, returned as manager in 1986, with Arsenal winning their first League Cup in 1987, Graham\\'s first season in charge. New signings Nigel Winterburn, Lee Dixon and Steve Bould had joined the club by 1988 to complete the \"famous Back Four\", led by homegrown player Tony Adams.[62][note 3] Graham\\'s credo of prioritising defensive excellence seemingly clashed with the club\\'s traditionally expansive motifs and many had skepticism whether it would work with the young squad at the club in that time period; however, his methods quickly gained a cult following after initial successes.[63]\\n\\nThe side immediately won the 1988 Football League Centenary Trophy, and followed it with the 1988–89 Football League title, snatched with a last-minute goal in the final game of the season against fellow title challengers Liverpool.[64] Graham\\'s Arsenal won another title in 1990–91, losing only one match, won the FA Cup and League Cup double in 1993, and the European Cup Winners\\' Cup in 1994. Graham\\'s reputation was tarnished when he was found to have taken kickbacks from agent Rune Hauge for signing certain players, and he was dismissed in 1995.[65][66] His replacement, Bruce Rioch, lasted for only one season, leaving the club after a dispute with the board of directors.[67]\\n\\n1996–2018: Arsene Wenger years\\n\\nAfter completing the only unbeaten Premier League season, a unique gold trophy was commissioned to Arsenal.\\nThe club metamorphosed during the tenure of French manager Arsène Wenger, who was appointed in 1996. Attacking football,[68] an overhaul of dietary and fitness practices,[note 4] and elite scouting[note 5] defined his reign. Accumulating key players from Wenger\\'s homeland, such as Patrick Vieira and Thierry Henry, Arsenal won a second League and Cup double in 1997–98 and a third in 2001–02. In addition, the club reached the final of the 1999–2000 UEFA Cup, were victorious in the 2003 and 2005 FA Cup finals, and won the Premier League in 2003–04 without losing a single match, an achievement which earned the side the nickname \"The Invincibles\".[77] This feat came within a run of 49 league matches unbeaten from 7 May 2003 to 24 October 2004, a national record.[78]\\n\\nArsenal finished in either first or second place in the league in eight of Wenger\\'s first nine seasons at the club, although they never won the title in two consecutive seasons.[79] The club had never progressed beyond the quarter-finals of the Champions League until 2005–06; in that season, they became the first club from London to reach the final in the competition\\'s fifty-year history, but were beaten 2–1 by Barcelona.[80] In July 2006, they moved into the Emirates Stadium, after 93 years at Highbury.[81] Arsenal reached the finals of the 2007 and 2011 League Cups, losing 2–1 to Chelsea and Birmingham City respectively. The club had not gained a trophy since the 2005 FA Cup until, spearheaded by club record acquisition Mesut Özil, Arsenal beat Hull City in the 2014 FA Cup Final, coming back from a 2–0 deficit to win the match 3–2.[82] A year later, Arsenal completed another victorious FA Cup campaign,[83] and became the most successful club in the tournament\\'s history by winning their 13th FA Cup in 2016–17. However, in that same season Arsenal finished fifth in the league, the first time they had finished outside the top four since before Wenger arrived in 1996.[84] In his 21st and final season, Arsenal under Arsene Wenger finished sixth and won the FA Community Shield.[85][86] Wenger departed Arsenal following the end of the season on 13 May 2018.[87]\\n\\n2018–2020: post-Wenger revolution\\nAfter conducting an overhaul in the club\\'s operating model to coincide with Wenger\\'s departure, Spaniard Unai Emery was named as the club\\'s new head coach on 23 May 2018. He became the club\\'s first ever \\'head coach\\' and second manager from outside the United Kingdom.[88][89] In Emery\\'s first season, Arsenal finished fifth in the Premier League and as runner-up in the Europa League.[90][91] On 29 November 2019, Emery was dismissed as manager and former player and assistant first team coach Freddie Ljungberg was appointed as interim head coach.[92][93][94]\\n\\n2020–: Mikel Arteta era\\nOn 20 December 2019, Arsenal appointed former club captain Mikel Arteta as the new head coach.[95][96] Arsenal finished the 2019–20 season in eighth, their lowest finish since 1994–95, but beat Chelsea 2–1 to earn a record-extending 14th FA Cup win.[97] After the season, Arteta\\'s title was changed from head coach to manager.[98] On 18 April 2021, Arsenal were announced as a founding club of the breakaway European competition The Super League;[99] they withdrew from the competition two days later amid near-universal condemnation.[100] Arsenal finished the 2020–21 season in eighth place once again, not qualifying for a European competition for the first time in 26 years.[101] The season after (2021–22), Arteta had assembled the youngest outfit in the Premier League with an average starting age of 24 years and 308 days – more than a whole year younger than the next team.[102][103] They finished in fifth in the Premier League that year, and qualified for next season\\'s UEFA Europa League.[104]\\n\\nBy the 2022–23 season, Arsenal returned to the Champions League by coming second to Manchester City, setting a record for most time spent on top of the table without actually winning the league, ending on 84 points.[105] In the 2023–24 season, Arsenal beat Manchester City to claim their 17th FA Community Shield, they finished second in the Premier League to Manchester City with an improved 89 points from their previous campaign.[106]\\n\\nCrest\\nCrests of Arsenal F.C. prior to current crest\\nRoyal Arsenal\\'s first crest, adopted in 1888, two years after the formation of the club\\nRoyal Arsenal\\'s first crest, adopted in 1888, two years after the formation of the club\\n \\n\\'Monogram\\' badge used in the 1930 FA Cup Final\\n\\'Monogram\\' badge used in the 1930 FA Cup Final\\n \\n\\'Art Deco Crest\\'\\n\\'Art Deco Crest\\'\\n \\nVersion of the \\'Art Deco Crest\\' worn in the 1952 FA Cup final\\nVersion of the \\'Art Deco Crest\\' worn in the 1952 FA Cup final\\n \\nCannon featured on shirt from 1960s to 1990s\\nCannon featured on shirt from 1960s to 1990s\\n \\nVCC crest: used between 1949 and 2002\\nVCC crest: used between 1949 and 2002\\nAlternative versions of the VCC crest\\n1990–1993 Arsenal crest\\nc.\\u20091990–1993\\n1996–2001 Arsenal crest\\nc.\\u20091994–1995\\n\\nc.\\u20091996–2001\\n2001–2002 Arsenal crest\\n2001–02 season\\nUnveiled in 1888, Royal Arsenal\\'s first crest featured three cannons viewed from above, pointing northwards, similar to the coat of arms of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich (nowadays transferred to the coat of arms of the Royal Borough of Greenwich). These can sometimes be mistaken for chimneys, but the presence of a carved lion\\'s head and a cascabel on each are clear indicators that they are cannons.[107] This was dropped after the move to Highbury in 1913, only to be reinstated in 1922, when the club adopted a crest featuring a single cannon, pointing eastwards, with the club\\'s nickname, The Gunners, inscribed alongside it; this crest only lasted until 1925, when the cannon was reversed to point westward and its barrel slimmed down.[107]\\n\\nIn 1949, the club unveiled a modernised crest featuring the same style of cannon below the club\\'s name, set in blackletter typography, and above the coat of arms of the Metropolitan Borough of Islington and a scroll inscribed with the club\\'s newly adopted Latin motto, Victoria Concordia Crescit (VCC) – \"victory comes from harmony\" – coined by the club\\'s programme editor Harry Homer.[107][108] For the first time, the crest was rendered in colour, which varied slightly over the crest\\'s lifespan, finally becoming red, gold and green. Because of the numerous revisions of the crest, Arsenal were unable to copyright it.[109] Although the club had managed to register the crest as a trademark, and had fought (and eventually won) a long legal battle with a local street trader who sold \"unofficial\" Arsenal merchandise,[110] Arsenal eventually sought a more comprehensive legal protection. Therefore, in 2002 they introduced a new crest featuring more modern curved lines and a simplified style, which was copyrightable.[111] The cannon once again faces east, and the club\\'s name is written in a sans-serif typeface above the cannon. Green was replaced by dark blue. The new crest was criticised by some supporters; the Arsenal Independent Supporters\\' Association claimed that the club had ignored much of Arsenal\\'s history and tradition with such a radical modern design, and that fans had not been properly consulted on the issue.[112] Until the 1960s, a badge was worn on the playing shirt only for high-profile matches such as FA Cup finals, usually in the form of a monogram of the club\\'s initials in red on a white background.[113]\\n\\nThe monogram theme was developed into an Art Deco-style badge on which the letters A and C framed a football rather than the letter F, the whole set within a hexagonal border. This early example of a corporate logo, introduced as part of Herbert Chapman\\'s rebranding of the club in the 1930s, was used not only on Cup Final shirts but as a design feature throughout Highbury Stadium, including above the main entrance and inlaid in the floors.[114] From 1967, a white cannon was regularly worn on the shirts, until replaced by the club crest, sometimes with the addition of the nickname \"The Gunners\", in the 1990s.[113]\\n\\nIn the 2011–12 season, Arsenal celebrated their 125th anniversary. The celebrations included a modified version of the current crest worn on their jerseys for the season. The crest was all-white, surrounded by 15 oak leaves to the right and 15 laurel leaves to the left. The oak leaves represent the 15 founding members of the club who met at the Royal Oak pub. The 15 laurel leaves represent the design detail on the six pence pieces paid by the founding fathers to establish the club. The laurel leaves also represent strength. To complete the crest, 1886 and 2011 are shown on either sides of the motto \"Forward\" at the bottom of the crest.[115]\\n\\nStarting in the 2021–22 season, Adidas reintroduced the cannon-only crest on that season\\'s away kit. It was the first time it had been seen on an Arsenal shirt since 1991. It would remain in use on the away kit in 2022–23 and in 2023–24 would be added to the third kit as well, before being used on all three kits in 2024–25 - marking the first time the crest would not be seen on an Arsenal kit since its introduction in 2002.[116]\\n\\nColours\\n\\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Arsenal F.C. kits.\\nDark red shirt, white shorts, socks with blue and white stripes\\nArsenal\\'s original home colours.

The choice of red is in recognition of a charitable donation from Nottingham Forest, soon after Arsenal\\'s foundation in 1886. Two of Dial Square\\'s founding members, Fred Beardsley and Morris Bates, were former Forest players who had moved to Woolwich for work. As they put together the first team in the area, no kit could be found, so Beardsley and Bates wrote home for help and received a set of kit and a ball.[117] The shirt was redcurrant, a dark shade of red, and was worn with white shorts and socks with blue and white hoops.[118][119]\\n\\nIn 1933, Herbert Chapman, wanting his players to be more distinctly dressed, updated the kit, adding white sleeves and changing the shade to a brighter pillar box red. Two possibilities have been suggested for the origin of the white sleeves. One story reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt; another was that he was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist Tom Webster, with whom Chapman played golf.[120] Regardless of which story is true, the red-and-white shirts have come to define Arsenal, and the team have worn that combination ever since that time, aside from two seasons. The first was 1966–67, when Arsenal wore all-red shirts;[119] this proved unpopular, and the white sleeves returned the following season. The second was 2005–06, the last season that Arsenal played at Highbury, when the team wore commemorative redcurrant shirts similar to those worn in 1913, their first season in the stadium; the side reverted to their normal colours at the start of the next season.[120] In the 2008–09 season, Arsenal replaced the traditional all-white sleeves with red sleeves that bore a broad white stripe.[119]\\n\\nArsenal\\'s home colours have been the inspiration for at least three other clubs. In 1909, Sparta Prague adopted a dark red kit like the one Arsenal wore at the time;[120] in 1938, Hibernian adopted the design of the Arsenal shirt sleeves in their own green-and-white strip.[121] In 1941, Luis Robledo, an England-schooled founder of Santa Fe and a fan of Arsenal, selected the main colours for his newly created team. In 1920, Sporting Clube de Braga\\'s manager returned from a game at Highbury and changed his team\\'s green kit to a duplicate of Arsenal\\'s red-with-white-sleeves-and-shorts, giving rise to the team\\'s nickname of Os Arsenalistas.[122] These teams still wear those designs to this day.\\n\\nFor many years Arsenal\\'s away colours were white or navy blue. However, in 1968 the FA banned navy shirts (they looked too similar to referees\\' black kit), so in the 1969–70 season Arsenal introduced an away kit of yellow shirts with blue shorts. This kit was worn in the 1971 FA Cup Final when Arsenal beat Liverpool to secure the double for the first time in their history. The yellow and blue strip became almost as famous as their iconic red-and-white home kit.[123][124] Arsenal reached the FA Cup final again the following year wearing the red-and-white home strip and were beaten by Leeds United. Arsenal then competed in three consecutive FA Cup finals between 1978 and 1980 wearing their \"lucky\" yellow and blue strip,[123] which remained the club\\'s away strip until the release of a green and navy away kit in 1982–83. The following season, Arsenal returned to the yellow and blue scheme, albeit with a darker shade of blue than before.\\n\\nWhen Nike took over from Adidas as Arsenal\\'s kit provider in 1994, Arsenal\\'s away colours were again changed to two-tone blue shirts and shorts. Since the advent of the lucrative replica kit market, the away kits have been changed regularly, with Arsenal usually releasing both away and third choice kits. During this period the designs have been either all blue designs, or variations on the traditional yellow and blue, such as the metallic gold and navy strip used in the 2001–02 season, the yellow and dark grey used from 2005 to 2007, and the yellow and maroon of 2010 to 2013.[125] Until 2014, the away kit was changed every season, and the outgoing away kit became the third-choice kit if a new home kit was being introduced in the same year.[126]\\n\\nAfter Puma began manufacturing Arsenal\\'s kits in 2014, new home, away and third kits were released every season. In the 2017–18 season, Puma released a new colour scheme for the away and third kits. The away kit was a light blue, which faded to a darker blue near the bottom, while the third kit was black with red highlight. Puma returned to the original colour scheme for the 2018–19 season.[127] From the 2019–20 season Arsenal\\'s kits are manufactured by Adidas.[128]\\n\\nKit suppliers and shirt sponsors\\nArsenal kits[129]\\nPeriod\\tKit manufacturer\\tShirt sponsor (chest)\\tShirt sponsor (sleeve)\\n1886–1930\\tUnidentified\\tNone\\tNone\\n1930–1970\\tBukta\\n1971–1981\\tUmbro\\n1981–1986\\tJVC\\n1986–1994\\tAdidas\\n1994–1999\\tNike\\n1999–2002\\tDreamcast\\nSega\\n2002–2006\\tO2\\n2006–2014\\tEmirates[130]\\n2014–2018\\tPuma\\n2018–2019\\tVisit Rwanda[131]\\n2019–present\\tAdidas[132]\\nStadiums\\n\\nManor Ground, Woolwich Arsenal vs. Everton\\nBefore joining the Football League, Arsenal played briefly on Plumstead Common, then at the Manor Ground in Plumstead, then spent three years between 1890 and 1893 at the nearby Invicta Ground. Upon joining the Football League in 1893, the club returned to the Manor Ground and installed stands and terracing, upgrading it from just a field. Arsenal continued to play their home games there for the next twenty years (with two exceptions in the 1894–95 season), until the move to north London in 1913.[133][134]\\n\\nWidely referred to as Highbury, Arsenal Stadium was the club\\'s home from September 1913 until May 2006. The original stadium was designed by the renowned football architect Archibald Leitch, and had a design common to many football grounds in the UK at the time, with a single covered stand and three open-air banks of terracing.[29] The entire stadium was given a massive overhaul in the 1930s: new Art Deco West and East stands were constructed, opening in 1932 and 1936 respectively, and a roof was added to the North Bank terrace, which was bombed during the Second World War and not restored until 1954.[29]\\n\\nHighbury could hold more than 60,000 spectators at its peak, and had a capacity of 57,000 until the early 1990s. The Taylor Report and Premier League regulations obliged Arsenal to convert Highbury to an all-seater stadium in time for the 1993–94 season, thus reducing the capacity to 38,419 seated spectators.[135] This capacity had to be reduced further during Champions League matches to accommodate additional advertising boards, so much so that for two seasons, from 1998 to 2000, Arsenal played Champions League home matches at Wembley, which could house more than 70,000 spectators.[136]\\n\\nA grandstand at a sports stadium. The seats are predominantly red.\\nThe North Bank Stand, Arsenal Stadium, Highbury\\nExpansion of Highbury was restricted because the East Stand had been designated as a Grade II listed building and the other three stands were close to residential properties.[29] These limitations prevented the club from maximising matchday revenue during the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, putting them in danger of being left behind in the football boom of that time.[137] After considering various options, in 2000 Arsenal proposed building a new 60,361-capacity stadium at Ashburton Grove, since named the Emirates Stadium, about 500 metres south-west of Highbury.[138] The project was initially delayed by red tape and rising costs,[139] and construction was completed in July 2006, in time for the start of the 2006–07 season.[140] The stadium was named after its sponsors, the airline company Emirates, with whom the club signed the largest sponsorship deal in English football history, worth around £100 million.[141] Some fans referred to the ground as Ashburton Grove, or the Grove, as they did not agree with corporate sponsorship of stadium names.[142] The stadium will be officially known as Emirates Stadium until at least 2028, and the airline will be the club\\'s shirt sponsor until at least 2024.[143][144] From the start of the 2010–11 season on, the stands of the stadium have been officially known as North Bank, East Stand, West Stand and Clock end.[145] The capacity of the Emirates now stands at 60,704.[146]\\n\\nArsenal\\'s players train at the Shenley Training Centre in Hertfordshire, a purpose-built facility which opened in 1999.[147] Before that the club used facilities on a nearby site owned by the University College of London Students\\' Union. Until 1961 they had trained at Highbury.[148] Arsenal\\'s Academy under-18 teams play their home matches at Shenley, while the reserves play their games at Meadow Park,[149] which is also the home of Boreham Wood. Both the Academy under-18 team and the reserves occasionally play their big games at the Emirates in front of a crowd reduced to only the lower west stand.[150][151]\\n\\n\\nA panorama of the Emirates Stadium before a match\\nSupporters and rivalries\\nFurther information: Arsenal F.C. supporters\\n\\nArsenal supporters\\nArsenal\\'s fanbase are referred to as \"Gooners\" – the name derived from the club\\'s nickname \"The Gunners\". Virtually all home matches sell out; in 2007–08 Arsenal had the second-highest average League attendance for an English club (60,070, which was 99.5% of available capacity),[152] and, as of 2015, the third-highest all-time average attendance.[153] Arsenal have the seventh highest average attendance of European football clubs only behind Borussia Dortmund, Barcelona, Manchester United, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Schalke 04.[154][155][156][157] The club\\'s location, adjoining wealthy areas such as Canonbury and Barnsbury, mixed areas such as Islington, Holloway, Highbury, and the adjacent London Borough of Camden, and largely working-class areas such as Finsbury Park and Stoke Newington, has meant that Arsenal\\'s supporters have come from a variety of social classes. Much of the Afro-Caribbean support comes from the neighbouring London Borough of Hackney and a large portion of the South Asian Arsenal supporters commute to the stadium from Wembley Park, North West of the capital. There was also traditionally a large Irish community that followed Arsenal, with the surrounding Islington and particularly the nearby Archway area having a large community of residents with Irish heritage. But Irish migration to North London is recently much lower than in the 1960s or 1970s.\\n\\nLike all major English football clubs, Arsenal have a number of domestic supporters\\' clubs, including the Arsenal Football Supporters\\' Club, which works closely with the club, and the Arsenal Independent Supporters\\' Association, which maintains a more independent line. The Arsenal Supporters\\' Trust promotes greater participation in ownership of the club by fans. The club\\'s supporters also publish fanzines such as The Gooner, Gunflash and the satirical Up The Arse!\\n\\nThere have always been Arsenal supporters outside London, and since the advent of satellite television, a supporter\\'s attachment to a football club has become less dependent on geography. Consequently, Arsenal have a significant number of fans from beyond London and all over the world; in 2007, 24 UK, 37 Irish and 49 other overseas supporters\\' clubs were affiliated with the club.[158] A 2011 report by SPORT+MARKT estimated Arsenal\\'s global fanbase at 113 million.[159] The club\\'s social media activity was the fifth highest in world football during the 2014–15 season.[160]\\n\\nChants\\nThe team\\'s anthem is \"The Angel (North London Forever)\" by Louis Dunford.[161][162][163] The song is typically played at Arsenal home games before a match.\\n\\nIn addition to the usual English football chants, Arsenal\\'s supporters sing \"One-Nil to the Arsenal\" (to the tune of \"Go West\") and also regularly sing \"Who\\'s that team they call the Arsenal\", \"Good Old Arsenal\" (to the tune of \"Rule, Britannia!\") and \"We\\'re the North Bank/Clock End Highbury\". The fans also chant \"Boring, Boring Arsenal\" in self-deprecating reference to Arsenal\\'s reputation during the 1970s and 1980s as an overly defensive, cautious team.[164]\\n\\nRivalries\\nMain articles: North London derby, Arsenal F.C.–Manchester United F.C. rivalry, Arsenal F.C.–Chelsea F.C. rivalry, and Arsenal F.C.–Manchester City F.C. rivalry\\n\\nArsenal playing against rivals Tottenham, in a game known as the North London derby, in November 2010\\nArsenal\\'s longest-running and deepest rivalry is with their nearest major neighbour, Tottenham Hotspur; matches between the two are referred to as the North London derby.[165] There also exists a rivalry between Arsenal and Chelsea. In addition, Arsenal and Manchester United developed a strong on-pitch rivalry in the late 1980s, which intensified in the early 2000s when both clubs were competing for the Premier League title.[166][167][168]\\n\\nMascot\\nThe club mascot is Gunnersaurus Rex, a smiling, seven-foot-tall green dinosaur, who first appeared at a home match against Manchester City in August 1994 (or 1993). He is based on a drawing by then-11-year-old Peter Lovell, whose design and another similar idea won a Junior Gunners contest; his official backstory is that he hatched from an egg found during renovations at Highbury.[169][170][171][172][173][174]\\n\\nThe same performer, Jerry Quy, has been inside the suit from the start; in early October 2020, as part of cost-cutting brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, the club made him redundant from that and his other part-time job in supporter liaison, together with 55 full-time employees, although they later said Gunnersaurus could return after spectators were allowed back in stadiums.[173][175][176] An online fundraiser was begun for Quy,[176] and Mesut Özil offered to pay his salary himself as long as he remains with Arsenal.[177][178] In November 2020, in advance of COVID-19 regulations being relaxed to allow supporters to attend home games from 3 December, Arsenal announced that Gunnersaurus would return, to be played by a roster of people that could include Quy if he wished.[179][180]\\n\\nOwnership and finances\\nFurther information: Ownership of Arsenal F.C. & W.F.C.\\nThe largest shareholder on the Arsenal board is American sports tycoon Stan Kroenke.[181] Kroenke first launched a bid for the club in April 2007,[182] and faced competition for shares from Red and White Securities, which acquired its first shares from David Dein in August 2007.[183] Red & White Securities was co-owned by Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov and London-based Iranian financier Farhad Moshiri, though Usmanov bought Moshiri\\'s stake in 2016.[184] Kroenke came close to the 30% takeover threshold in November 2009, when he increased his holding to 18,594 shares (29.9%).[185][186] In April 2011, Kroenke achieved a full takeover by purchasing the shareholdings of Nina Bracewell-Smith and Danny Fiszman, taking his shareholding to 62.89%.[187][188] In May 2017, Kroenke owned 41,721 shares (67.05%) and Red & White Securities owned 18,695 shares (30.04%).[181] In January 2018, Kroenke expanded his ownership by buying twenty-two more shares, taking his total ownership to 67.09%.[189] In August 2018, Kroenke bought out Usmanov for £550m. Now owning more than 90% of the shares, he had the required stake to complete the buyout of the remaining shares and become the sole owner.[190] There has been criticism of Arsenal\\'s poor performance since Kroenke took over, which has been attributed to his ownership.[191] Ivan Gazidis was the club\\'s Chief executive from 2009 to 2018.[181][192]\\n\\nArsenal\\'s parent company, Arsenal Holdings plc, operates as an unlisted public limited company, whose ownership is considerably different from that of other football clubs. Only 62,219 shares in Arsenal have been issued,[181] and they are not traded on a public exchange such as the FTSE or AIM; instead, they are traded relatively infrequently on the ICAP Securities and Derivatives Exchange, a specialist market. On 29 May 2017, a single share in Arsenal had a mid price of £18,000, which sets the club\\'s market capitalisation value at approximately £1,119.9m.[193] Most football clubs are not listed on an exchange, which makes direct comparisons of their values difficult. Consultants Brand Finance valued the club\\'s brand and intangible assets at $703m in 2015, and consider Arsenal an AAA global brand.[194] Business magazine Forbes valued Arsenal as a whole at $2.238 billion (£1.69 billion) in 2018, ranked third in English football.[195] Research by the Henley Business School ranked Arsenal second in English football, modelling the club\\'s value at £1.118 billion in 2015.[196][197]\\n\\nArsenal\\'s financial results for the 2019–20 season showed an after tax loss of £47.8m, due in part to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.[198] The Deloitte Football Money League is a publication that homogenises and compares clubs\\' annual revenue. Deloitte put Arsenal\\'s footballing revenue in 2019 at £392.7m (€445.6m),[199] ranking Arsenal eleventh among world football clubs.[160] Arsenal and Deloitte both listed the match day revenue generated in 2019 by the Emirates Stadium as €109.2m (£96.2m).[199]\\n\\nIn popular culture\\nPartly due to their proximity to the Alexandra Palace transmitter, Arsenal have appeared in a number of media \"firsts\". On 22 January 1927, their match at Highbury against Sheffield United was the first English League match to be broadcast live on radio.[200][201] A decade later, on 16 September 1937, an exhibition match between Arsenal\\'s first team and the reserves was the first football match in the world to be televised live.[200][202] Arsenal also featured in the first edition of the BBC\\'s Match of the Day, which screened highlights of their match against Liverpool at Anfield on 22 August 1964.[200][203] Sky\\'s coverage of Arsenal\\'s January 2010 match against Manchester United was the first live public broadcast of a sports event on 3D television.[200][204]\\n\\nAs one of the most successful teams in the country, Arsenal have often featured when football is depicted in the arts in Britain. They formed the backdrop to one of the earliest football-related novels, The Arsenal Stadium Mystery (1939), which was made into a film in the same year.[205] The story centres on a friendly match between Arsenal and an amateur side, one of whose players is poisoned while playing. Many Arsenal players appeared as themselves in the film and manager George Allison was given a speaking part.[206] The book Fever Pitch by Nick Hornby was an autobiographical account of Hornby\\'s life and relationship with football, and with Arsenal in particular. Published in 1992, it formed part of the revival and rehabilitation of football in British society during the 1990s.[207] The book was twice adapted for the cinema – the 1997 British film focuses on Arsenal\\'s 1988–89 title win, and a 2005 American version features a fan of baseball\\'s Boston Red Sox.[208]\\n\\nArsenal have often been stereotyped as a defensive and \"boring\" side, especially during the 1970s and 1980s.[209][210] In the 1997 film The Full Monty the principal characters move forward in a line and raise their hands, deliberately mimicking the Arsenal defence\\'s offside trap, in an attempt to co-ordinate their striptease routine.[206] Fifteen years later, an almost identical scene was included in the 2012 Disney science-fiction film John Carter (director and co-writer Andrew Stanton, a notable overseas supporter of the club), along with other visual cues and oblique dialogue hints and references to the club throughout the film.[211] Another film reference to the club\\'s defence comes in the film Plunkett & Macleane, in which two characters are named Dixon and Winterburn after Arsenal\\'s long-serving full backs – the right-sided Lee Dixon and the left-sided Nigel Winterburn.[206]\\n\\nIn August 2022, Amazon Prime Video released an eight-episode docuseries called All or Nothing: Arsenal.[212][213] It documented the club by spending time with the coaching staff and players behind the scenes both on and off the field throughout their 2021–22 season, in which they were the youngest team in the Premier League with an average starting age of 24 years and 308 days – more than a whole year younger than the next team.[214][215]\\n\\nIn the community\\nIn 1985, Arsenal founded a community scheme, \"Arsenal in the Community\", which offered sporting, social inclusion, educational and charitable projects. The club support a number of charitable causes directly and in 1992 established The Arsenal Charitable Trust, which by 2006 had raised more than £2 million for local causes.[216] An ex-professional and celebrity football team associated with the club also raised money by playing charity matches.[217] The club launched the Arsenal for Everyone initiative in 2008 as an annual celebration of the diversity of the Arsenal family.[218] In the 2009–10 season Arsenal announced that they had raised a record breaking £818,897 for the Great Ormond Street Hospital Children\\'s Charity. The original target was £500,000.[219] In 2022, Arsenal and Adidas partnered up to launch the \"No More Red\" campaign to support the long-standing work being done by Arsenal in the Community to help keep young people safe from knife crime and youth violence. To promote the event, the club launched an exclusive all white kit that was not commercially available and only awarded to individuals who are making a positive difference in the community.[220]\\n\\nSave the Children has been Arsenal global charity partner since 2011 and have worked together in numerous projects to improve safety and well-being for vulnerable children in London and abroad. On 3 September 2016 The Arsenal Foundation has donated £1m to build football pitches for children in London, Indonesia, Iraq, Jordan and Somalia thanks to The Arsenal Foundation Legends Match against Milan Glorie at the Emirates Stadium.[221] On 3 June 2018, Arsenal played Real Madrid in the Corazon Classic Match 2018 at the Bernabeu, where the proceeds went to Realtoo Real Madrid Foundation projects that are aimed at the most vulnerable children. In addition there will be a return meeting on 8 September 2018 at the Emirates stadium where proceeds will go towards the Arsenal foundation.[222]\\n\\nDuring 2007 in Pleiku, Vietnam, Arsenal partnered with the JMG Academy and the Hoang Anh Gia Lai Corporation to found a youth academy for the V.League 1 side Hoàng Anh Lai Lai,[223] which saw a selection of Vietnam-based players train with Arsenal;[224] the club ended their partnership with the club in 2017.[225] Additionally, the club formally partnered with a variety of clubs overseas including Virginia based Richmond Strikers and Cairo based Wadi Degla.[226][227]\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'FC Barcelona': 'Futbol Club Barcelona (Catalan pronunciation: [fubˈbɔl ˈklub bəɾsəˈlonə] ⓘ), commonly known as FC Barcelona and colloquially as Barça ([ˈbaɾsə]), is a professional football club based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, that competes in La Liga, the top flight of Spanish football.\\n\\nFounded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Catalan, German, and English footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto \"Més que un club\" (\"More than a club\").[2] Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the third-most valuable football club in the world, worth $5.6 billion, and the world\\'s fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €800.1 million.[3][4] The official Barcelona anthem is the \"Cant del Barça\", written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs.[5] Barcelona traditionally play in dark shades of blue and garnet stripes, hence nicknamed Blaugrana.\\n\\nBarcelona are one of the world\\'s most decorated clubs. Domestically, Barcelona has won a record 78 trophies: 27 La Liga, 31 Copa del Rey, 2 Copa de la Liga, 15 Supercopa de España and 3 Copa Eva Duarte titles, as well as being the record holder for the latter four competitions. In international club football, Barça has won 22 European and worldwide titles: five UEFA Champions League titles, a record four UEFA Cup Winners\\' Cups, a record three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, five UEFA Super Cups, a joint record two Latin Cups and three FIFA Club World Cups.[6][7][8] Barcelona was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 1997, 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2015, and occupies the ninth position on the UEFA club rankings as of May 2023.[9][10][11] The club has a long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid, and matches between the two teams are referred to as El Clásico.\\n\\nBarcelona is one of the most widely supported teams in the world, and the club has one of the largest social media followings in the world among sports teams.[12][13] Barcelona players have won a joint record twelve Ballon d\\'Or awards, with recipients including Johan Cruyff, as well as a record six FIFA World Player of the Year awards, with winners including Romário, Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Ronaldinho and Lionel Messi. In 2010, three players who came through the club\\'s youth academy—Lionel Messi, Andrés Iniesta and Xavi—were chosen as the three best players in the world in the Ballon d\\'Or ranking, an unprecedented feat for players from the same football academy.[14][15] Additionally, players representing the club have won a record eight European Golden Shoe awards.[16]\\n\\nBarcelona is one of three founding members of the Primera División that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929, along with Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid.[17][18] In 2009, Barcelona became the first Spanish club to win the continental treble consisting of La Liga, Copa del Rey and UEFA Champions League titles, and also became the first European football club to win six competitions in a single year, by also triumphing in the Spanish Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup.[19] In 2011, the club became European champions again, winning five trophies.[20] This Barcelona team, which won fourteen trophies in just four years under Pep Guardiola, is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest of all time.[21][22][23] By winning their fifth Champions League trophy in 2015 under Luis Enrique, Barcelona became the first European football club in history to achieve the continental treble twice.[24]\\n\\nHistory\\nMain article: History of FC Barcelona\\nSee also: List of FC Barcelona seasons\\n1899–1922: Beginnings\\n\\nWalter Wild, the club\\'s first president (1899–1901).

Eleven players attended – Walter Wild (the first president of the club), Luis de Ossó, Bartomeu Terradas, Otto Kunzle, Otto Maier, Enric Ducal, Pere Cabot, Carles Pujol, Josep Llobet, John Parsons, and William Parsons – and formed Foot-Ball Club Barcelona.[26][27]\\n\\n\\nA formation of FC Barcelona in 1903\\nFC Barcelona had a successful start in regional and national cups, competing in the Campionat de Catalunya and the Copa del Rey. In 1901, the club participated in the first football competition played on the Iberian Peninsula, the Copa Macaya, narrowly losing to Hispania AC, but in the following year, Barça won the tournament, the club\\'s first-ever piece of silverware,[28] and then participated in the first Copa del Rey, losing 1–2 to Bizcaya (a combination of players from Athletic Club and Bilbao FC) in the final.[29] In 1908, Hans Gamper – now known as Joan Gamper – became club president, attempting to prevent Barcelona from shutting down. The club was struggling financially and socially, as well as in performance. They had not won a competition since the Campionat de Catalunya in 1905. He said in a meeting, \"Barcelona cannot die and must not die. If there is nobody who is going to try, then I will assume the responsibility of running the club from now on.\"[30] He was club president on five separate occasions between 1908 and 1925, spending a total of 25 years in the role. One of his main achievements was ensuring Barça acquired its own stadium and thus generated a stable income.[31]\\n\\nOn 14 March 1909, the team moved into the Camp de la Indústria, a stadium with a capacity of 8,000. To celebrate their new surroundings, the club conducted a logo contest the following year. Carles Comamala won the contest, and his suggestion became the crest that the club still wears – with some minor changes – as of the present day.[32]\\n\\nThe stadium is regarded as the main element that helped the club grow in the 1910s and become a dominant team,[33] winning three successive Campionats de Catalunya between 1909 and 1911, three Copa del del Rey in four years between 1910 and 1913, and four successive Pyrenees Cup between the inaugural year in 1910 and 1913. The Pyrenees Cup was one of the earliest international club cups in Europe. It consisted of the best teams of Languedoc, Midi and Aquitaine (Southern France), the Basque Country and Catalonia, all former members of the Marca Hispanica region. The contest was the most prestigious in that era.[34] Notable figures of Barça\\'s first great team include Carles Comamala, Alfredo Massana, Amechazurra, Paco Bru, and Jack Greenwell.[35] The latter became the club\\'s first full-time coach in 1917.[36]\\n\\nDuring the same period, the club changed its official language from Castilian to Catalan and gradually evolved into an important symbol of Catalan identity. For many fans, participating in the club had less to do with the game itself and more with being a part of the club\\'s collective identity.[37] On 4 February 1917, the club held its first tribute match to honour Ramón Torralba, who played from 1913 to 1928. The match was against local side Terrassa where Barcelona won the match 6–2.[38]\\n\\nGamper simultaneously launched a campaign to recruit more club members, and by 1922, the club had more than 20,000, who helped finance a new stadium. The club then moved to the new Les Cortes, which they inaugurated the same year.[39] Les Cortes had an initial capacity of 30,000, and in the 1940s it was expanded to 60,000.[40]\\n\\nIn 1912, Gamper recruited Paulino Alcántara, the club\\'s seventh all-time top-scorer. In 1917, Gamper also recruited Jack Greenwell as Barcelona\\'s first full-time manager. After this hiring, the club\\'s fortunes began to improve on the field and soon enjoyed its first \"golden age\". Along with Alcántara, the Barça team under Greenwell also included Sagibarba, Ricardo Zamora, Josep Samitier, Félix Sesúmaga, and Franz Platko.[41] This team won 9 out of 10 Campionats de Catalunya between 1919 and 1928 and two Copa del Rey titles in 1920 and 1922. In total, during the Gamper-led era, Barcelona won eleven Campionats de Catalunya, six Copa del Rey and four Pyrenees Cups.[42][31]\\n\\n1923–1931: Primo de Rivera, and first golden age\\nOn 14 June 1925, in a spontaneous reaction against Primo de Rivera\\'s dictatorship, the crowd in the stadium jeered the Royal March. As a reprisal, the ground was closed for six months and Gamper was forced to relinquish the presidency of the club.[43] This coincided with the club\\'s transition to professional football. The first time the directors of Barcelona publicly claimed to operate a professional football club was in 1926.[39]\\n\\n\\nTeam of FC Barcelona, published on El Gráfico, 1926\\nOn 3 July 1927, the club held a second testimonial match for Paulino Alcántara, against the Spanish national team. To kick off the match, local journalist and pilot Josep Canudas dropped the ball onto the pitch from his aeroplane.[44] In 1928, victory in the Spanish Cup was celebrated with a poem titled \"Oda a Platko\", which was written by a member of the Generation of \\'27, Rafael Alberti, inspired by the performance of the Barcelona goalkeeper, Franz Platko.[45] On 23 June 1929, Barcelona won the inaugural Spanish League. A year after winning the championship, on 30 July 1930, Gamper committed suicide after a period of depression brought on by personal and financial problems.[31]\\n\\n1931–1939: Republic, and Civil War: Assassination of President Sunyol\\nAlthough they continued to have players of the standing of Josep Escolà, the club now entered a period of decline, in which political conflict overshadowed sports throughout society. Attendance at matches dropped as the citizens of Barcelona were occupied with discussing political matters.[46] Although the team won the Campionat de Catalunya in 1930, 1931, 1932, 1934, 1936, and 1938,[42] they did not win at a national level in this time, with the exception of their 1937 disputed title in the Mediterranean League.\\n\\nA month after the Spanish Civil War began in 1936, several players from Barcelona enlisted in the ranks of those who fought against the military uprising, along with players from Athletic Bilbao.[47] On 6 August, Falangist soldiers near Guadarrama murdered club president Josep Sunyol, a representative of the pro-independence political party.[48] He was dubbed the martyr of barcelonisme, and his assassination was a defining moment in the history of FC Barcelona and Catalan identity.[49] In the summer of 1937, the squad was on tour in Mexico and the United States, where it was received as an ambassador of the Second Spanish Republic. The tour led to the financial security of the club, but also resulted in half of the team seeking asylum in Mexico and France, making it harder for the remaining team to contest for trophies.[50][51]\\n\\nOn 16 March 1938, Barcelona came under aerial bombardment from the Italian Air Force, causing more than 3,000 deaths, with one of the bombs hitting the club\\'s offices.[52][53] A few months later, Catalonia came under occupation, and as a symbol of the \"undisciplined\" Catalanism, the club, now down to just 3,486 members, faced a number of restrictions. All signs of regional nationalism, including language, flag and other signs of separatism were banned throughout Spain. The Catalan flag was banned and the club were prohibited from using non-Spanish names. These measures forced the club to change its name to Club de Fútbol Barcelona and to remove the Catalan flag from its crest.[54]\\n\\n1940–1957: Post-war, and start of Franco\\'s regime\\n\\nA prolific forward, László Kubala led Barcelona to success in the 1950s. His statue is built outside Camp Nou.\\nIn 1943, Barcelona faced rivals Real Madrid in the semi-finals of Copa del Generalísimo (now the Copa del Rey). The first match at Les Corts was won by Barcelona 3–0. Real Madrid comfortably won the second leg, beating Barcelona 11–1.[55] According to football writer Sid Lowe, \"There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11–1 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona\\'s history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims.\"[56] It has been alleged by local journalist Paco Aguilar that Barcelona\\'s players were threatened by police in the changing room, though nothing was ever proven.[57]\\n\\nDespite the difficult political situation, CF Barcelona enjoyed considerable success during the 1940s and 1950s. In 1945, with Josep Samitier as coach and players like César, Ramallets and Velasco, they won La Liga for the first time since 1929. They added two more titles in 1948 and 1949.[58] In 1949, they also won the first Copa Latina.[59] In June 1950, Barcelona signed László Kubala, who was to be an important figure at the club.[60]\\n\\nOn a rainy Sunday of 1951, the crowd left Les Corts stadium after a 2–1 win against Santander by foot, refusing to catch any trams, and surprising the Francoist authorities. A tram strike was taking place in Barcelona, and it received the support of blaugrana fans. Events like this made CF Barcelona represent much more than just Catalonia. Many progressive Spaniards saw the club as a staunch defender of rights and freedoms.[61][62]\\n\\nCoach Ferdinand Daučík and László Kubala led the team to five different trophies in 1952. These were La Liga, the Copa del Generalísimo, the Copa Latina, the Copa Eva Duarte, and the Copa Martini & Rossi. In 1953, the club won La Liga and the Copa del Generalísimo again.[40]\\n\\n1957–1978: Club de Fútbol Barcelona\\nWith Helenio Herrera as coach, a young Luis Suárez, the European Footballer of the Year in 1960, and two Hungarians recommended by Kubala, Sándor Kocsis and Zoltán Czibor, the team won another national double in 1959 and a La Liga and Fairs Cup double in 1960. In 1961, they became the first club to beat Real Madrid in a European Cup play-off. However, they lost 2–3 to Benfica in the final.[63][64]\\n\\n\\nLuis Suárez, the first Barcelona player to win the Ballon d\\'Or.\\nThe 1960s were less successful for the club, with Real Madrid monopolising La Liga. The completion of Camp Nou, finished in 1957, meant the club had little money to spend on new players.[64] The 1960s saw the emergence of Josep Maria Fusté and Carles Rexach, and the club won the Copa del Generalísimo in 1963 and the Fairs Cup in 1966. Barcelona beat Real Madrid 1–0 in the 1968 Copa del Generalísimo final at the Santiago Bernabéu in front of dictator Francisco Franco, with coach Salvador Artigas, a former republican pilot in the Civil War. With the end of Franco\\'s dictatorship in 1974, the club changed its official name back to Futbol Club Barcelona and reverted the crest to its original design, including the original letters.[65][66]\\n\\nJohan Cruyff joined in the 1973–74 season. He was bought for a world record £920,000 from Ajax.[67] Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son \"Jordi\", after the local Catalan Saint George.[68] Next to champions like Juan Manuel Asensi, Carles Rexach and Hugo Sotil, he helped the club win the 1973–74 season for the first time since 1960,[42] defeating Real Madrid 5–0 at the Santiago Bernabéu en route. He was crowned European Footballer of the Year in 1973 during his first season with Barcelona (his second Ballon d\\'Or win; he won his first while playing for Ajax in 1971). Cruyff received this award a third time (the first player to do so) in 1974, while he was still with Barcelona.[69]\\n\\n1978–2000: Núñez and stabilization\\n\\nIn 1979, Barcelona bought La Masia, a farmer\\'s house built in 1702, to be a residence for young academy players. It would later play a significant role in the club\\'s future success.[70][71]\\nIn 1978, Josep Lluís Núñez became the first elected president of FC Barcelona. Since then, the members of Barcelona have elected the club president. The process of electing a president of FC Barcelona was closely tied to Spain\\'s transition to democracy in 1974 and the end of Franco\\'s dictatorship. The new president\\'s main objective was to develop Barcelona into a world-class club by giving it stability both on and off the pitch. His presidency lasted 22 years. It deeply affected the image of Barcelona, as Núñez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline, letting go of such players as Diego Maradona, Romário and Ronaldo rather than meeting their demands.[72][73]\\n\\nThe club won its first European Cup Winners\\' Cup on 16 May 1979, beating Fortuna Düsseldorf 4–3 in Basel. More than 30,000 travelling blaugrana fans watched the final. The same year, Núñez began to invest in the club\\'s youth programme by converting La Masia into a dormitory for young academy players from abroad. The name of the dormitory would later become synonymous with the youth programme of Barcelona.[74]\\n\\n\\nDiego Maradona\\'s blaugrana shirt on display in the FC Barcelona Museum\\nIn June 1982, Diego Maradona was signed for a world record fee of £5 million from Boca Juniors.[75] In the following season, under coach César Luis Menotti, Barcelona won the Copa del Rey, beating Real Madrid. Maradona soon left to join Napoli. At the start of the 1984–85 season, Terry Venables was hired as manager. He won La Liga with noteworthy displays by German midfielder Bernd Schuster. The next season, he took the team to their second European Cup final. The team lost on penalties to Steaua București in Seville.[72]\\n\\nAround this time, tensions began to arise between what was perceived as president Núñez\\'s dictatorial rule and the nationalistic support group, Boixos Nois. The group, identified with a left-wing separatism, repeatedly demanded the resignation of Núñez and openly defied him through chants and banners at matches. At the same time, Barcelona experienced an eruption in skinheads, who often identified with a right-wing separatism. The skinheads slowly transferred the Boixos Nois\\' ideology from liberalism to fascism, which caused division within the group and a sudden support for Núñez\\'s presidency.[76] Inspired by British hooligans, the remaining Boixos Nois became violent, causing havoc leading to large-scale arrests.[77]\\n\\nAfter the 1986 FIFA World Cup, Barcelona signed the English top scorer Gary Lineker, along with goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, but the team could not achieve success, as Schuster was excluded from the team. Terry Venables was fired at the beginning of the 1987–88 season and replaced with Luis Aragonés. The season finished with the players rebelling against president Núñez, in an event known as the Hesperia mutiny, and a 1–0 victory in the Copa del Rey final against Real Sociedad.[72]\\n\\n\\nAs coach of the \"Dream Team\", Johan Cruyff won four consecutive league titles with Barcelona.\\nIn 1988, Johan Cruyff returned to the club, this time as manager. He assembled what would later be dubbed the \"Dream Team\".[78] He used Spanish players like Pep Guardiola, José Mari Bakero, Jon Andoni Goikoetxea, Miguel Angel Nadal, and Txiki Begiristain, and signed international players such as Ronald Koeman, Michael Laudrup, Romário, and Hristo Stoichkov.[79]\\n\\nTen years after the inception of the youth programme, La Masia, its players began to graduate and play for their first team. Pep Guardiola, the future coach of Barcelona, was one of the first graduates and would go on to receive international recognition.[80] Under Cruyff\\'s guidance, Barcelona won four consecutive La Liga titles from 1991 to 1994. They beat Sampdoria in both the 1989 UEFA Cup Winners\\' Cup final and the 1992 European Cup final at Wembley, with a free kick goal from Dutch international Ronald Koeman. They also won a Copa del Rey in 1990, the European Super Cup in 1992 and three Supercopa de España trophies.[81] With 11 trophies, Cruyff became the club\\'s most successful manager at that point. He also became the club\\'s longest consecutive serving manager, serving eight years.[82] Cruyff did not win any trophies in his final two seasons, and fell out with president Josep Lluís Núñez, resulting in his departure.[72]\\n\\nReacting to Cruyff\\'s departure, an independent protest group was organised by Armand Caraben, Joan Laporta and Alfons Godall.[83] The objective of the group, called L\\'Elefant Blau, was to oppose the presidency of Núñez, which they regarded as a corruption of the club\\'s traditional values.[83][84] Laporta would later take over the presidency of Barcelona in 2003.[85]\\n\\nCruyff was briefly replaced by Bobby Robson, who took charge of the club for a single season in 1996–97. He recruited Ronaldo for a world record transfer fee from his previous club, PSV, and delivered a cup treble, winning the Copa del Rey, UEFA Cup Winners\\' Cup and the Supercopa de España, with Ronaldo registering 47 goals in 49 games.[86] Despite his success, Robson was only ever seen as a short-term solution while the club waited for Louis van Gaal to become available.[87]\\n\\nRonaldo soon left for Inter Milan in another world record transfer.[86] However, new heroes emerged, such as Luís Figo, Patrick Kluivert, Luis Enrique and Rivaldo, and the team won a Copa del Rey and La Liga double in 1998. In 1999, the club celebrated its centenari, winning the Primera División title, and Rivaldo became the fourth Barcelona player to be awarded European Footballer of the Year. Despite this domestic success, the failure to emulate Real Madrid in the Champions League led to van Gaal and Núñez resigning in 2000.[87]\\n\\n2000–2008: Exit Núñez, enter Laporta\\n\\nRonaldinho\\'s arrival in 2003 revitalized the club.[88][89]\\nThe departures of Núñez and Van Gaal were hardly noticed by the fans when compared to that of Luís Figo, then club vice-captain. Figo had become a cult hero and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. Barcelona fans, however, were distraught by Figo\\'s decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to Camp Nou, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet\\'s head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd.[90] The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. Van Gaal was replaced by Lorenzo Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a first-round Champions League exit, and was dismissed late in the season. Long-serving Barcelona deputy coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot on the final day of the season against Valencia via an exceptional performance from Rivaldo, who completed arguably the greatest hat-trick in history with an overhead bicycle kick winner in the final minute to secure qualification.[91][92][93]\\n\\nDespite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager. What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the club\\'s history, with the team as low as 15th in February 2003. This led to Van Gaal\\'s resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign by Radomir Antić, though a sixth-place finish was the best that he could manage. At the end of the season, Antić\\'s short-term contract was not renewed, and club president Joan Gaspart resigned, his position having been made completely untenable by such a disastrous season on top of the club\\'s overall decline in fortunes since he became president three years prior.[94]\\n\\nAfter the disappointment of the Gaspart era, the combination of a new young president, Joan Laporta, and a young new manager, former Dutch and AC Milan star Frank Rijkaard, saw the club bounce back. On the field, an influx of international players, including Ronaldinho, Deco, Henrik Larsson, Ludovic Giuly, Samuel Eto\\'o, Rafael Márquez and Edgar Davids, combined with home grown Spanish players, such as Carles Puyol, Andrés Iniesta, Xavi and Víctor Valdés, led to the club\\'s return to success. Barcelona won La Liga and the Supercopa de España in 2004–05, and Ronaldinho and Eto\\'o were voted first and third, respectively, in the FIFA World Player of the Year awards.[95]\\n\\nIn the 2005–06 season, Barcelona repeated their league and Supercopa successes. The pinnacle of the league season arrived at the Santiago Bernabéu in a 3–0 win over Real Madrid. It was Rijkaard\\'s second victory at the Bernabéu, making him the first Barcelona manager to win there twice. Ronaldinho\\'s performance was so impressive that after his second goal, which was Barcelona\\'s third, some Real Madrid fans gave him a standing ovation.[96] In the Champions League, Barcelona beat English club Arsenal in the final. Trailing 1–0 to a ten-man Arsenal and with less than 15 minutes remaining, they came back to win 2–1, with substitute Henrik Larsson, in his final appearance for the club, setting up goals for Samuel Eto\\'o and fellow substitute Juliano Belletti, for the club\\'s first European Cup victory in 14 years.[97]\\n\\nDespite being the favourites and starting strongly, Barcelona finished the 2006–07 season without trophies. A pre-season US tour was later blamed for a string of injuries to key players, including leading scorer Eto\\'o and rising star Lionel Messi. There was open feuding as Eto\\'o publicly criticised coach Rijkaard and Ronaldinho.[98] Ronaldinho also admitted that a lack of fitness affected his form.[99] In La Liga, Barcelona were in first place for much of the season, but inconsistency in the New Year saw Real Madrid overtake them to become champions. Barcelona advanced to the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey, winning the first leg against Getafe 5–2, with a goal from Messi bringing comparison to Diego Maradona\\'s goal of the century, but then lost the second leg 4–0. They took part in the 2006 FIFA Club World Cup, but were beaten by a late goal in the final against Brazilian side Internacional.[100] In the Champions League, Barcelona were knocked out of the competition in the last 16 by eventual runners-up Liverpool on away goals.[101]\\n\\nBarcelona finished the 2007–08 season third in La Liga and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League and Copa del Rey, both times losing to the eventual champions, Manchester United and Valencia, respectively. The day after a 4–1 defeat to Real Madrid, Joan Laporta announced that Barcelona B coach Pep Guardiola would take over Frank Rijkaard\\'s duties on 30 June 2008.[102]\\n\\n2008–2012: Guardiola era\\nA man wearing long, dark blue shorts and a light blue sweatshirt under an orange bib.\\nA man wearing a light blue sweatshirt and dark blue shorts.\\nBarcelona\\'s midfield combination of Andrés Iniesta (left) and Xavi (right) were at the heart of Guardiola\\'s tiki-taka passing style of play.[103]\\nBarcelona B youth manager Pep Guardiola took over Frank Rijkaard\\'s duties at the conclusion of the season.[102] Guardiola brought with him the now famous tiki-taka style of play he had been taught during his time in the Barcelona youth teams. In the process, Guardiola sold Ronaldinho and Deco and started building the Barcelona team around Xavi, Andrés Iniesta and Lionel Messi.[104]\\n\\n\\nLionel Messi in action during the 2009 UEFA Champions League Final victory against Manchester United.\\nBarça beat Athletic Bilbao 4–1 in the 2009 Copa del Rey final, winning the competition for a record-breaking 25th time.[105] A historic 2–6 victory against Real Madrid followed three days later and ensured that Barcelona became 2008–09 La Liga champions.[106] Barça finished the season by beating Manchester United 2–0 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, with goals from Eto\\'o and Messi, to win their third Champions League title, and complete the first ever treble won by a Spanish team.[107][108][109] The team went on to win the 2009 Supercopa de España against Athletic Bilbao[110] and the 2009 UEFA Super Cup against Shakhtar Donetsk,[111] becoming the first European club to win both domestic and European Super Cups following a treble. In December 2009, Barcelona won the 2009 Club World Cup.[112] Barcelona accomplished two new records in Spanish football in 2010 as they retained the La Liga trophy with 99 points and won the Supercopa de España for a ninth time.[113][114]\\n\\nAfter Laporta\\'s departure from the club in June 2010, Sandro Rosell was soon elected as the new president. The elections were held on 13 June, where he received 61.35% (57,088 votes, a record) of total votes.[115] Rosell signed David Villa from Valencia for €40 million[116] and Javier Mascherano from Liverpool for €19 million.[117] At the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Barcelona players that had graduated from the club\\'s La Masia youth system would play a major role in Spain becoming world champions. On 11 July, seven players who came through the academy participated in the final, six of whom were Barcelona players who started the match, with Iniesta scoring the winning goal against the Netherlands.[118]\\n\\nIn November 2010, Barcelona defeated their main rival Real Madrid 5–0 in El Clásico.[119] At the ceremony for the 2010 FIFA Ballon d\\'Or in December, Barcelona\\'s La Masia became the first youth academy ever to have all three finalists for the Ballon d\\'Or, with Messi, Iniesta and Xavi being named the three best players in the world for 2010.[120] In the 2010–11 season, Barcelona retained the La Liga trophy, their third title in succession, finishing with 96 points.[121] In April 2011, the club reached the Copa del Rey final, losing 1–0 to Real Madrid at the Mestalla Stadium in Valencia.[122] In May, Barcelona defeated Manchester United in the 2011 Champions League Final 3–1 held at Wembley Stadium, a repeat of the 2009 final, winning their fourth European Cup.[123] In August 2011, La Masia graduate Cesc Fàbregas was bought from Arsenal and he would help Barcelona defend the Spanish Supercup against Real Madrid. The Supercup victory brought the total number of official trophies to 73, matching the number of titles won by Real Madrid.[124]\\n\\nLater the same month, Barcelona won the UEFA Super Cup defeating Porto 2–0 with goals from Messi and Fàbregas. This extended the club\\'s overall number of official trophies to 74, surpassing Real Madrid\\'s total amount of official trophies.[125] The Super Cup victory also saw Guardiola win his 12th trophy out of a possible 15 in his three years at the helm of the club, becoming the all-time record holder of most titles won as a coach at Barcelona.[126]\\n\\n\\nBarcelona celebrating their 2011 FIFA Club World Cup win against Santos FC\\nIn December, Barcelona won the Club World Cup for a record second time since its establishment, after defeating 2011 Copa Libertadores holders Santos 4–0 in the final thanks to two goals from Messi and goals from Xavi and Fàbregas.[127] As a result, the overall trophy haul during the reign of Guardiola was further extended and saw Barcelona win their 13th trophy out of a possible 16.[128][129] Considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time, with Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson stating, ”They mesmerise you with their passing”,[22] their five trophies in 2011 saw them receive the Laureus World Sports Award for Team of the Year.[130]\\n\\nIn the 2011–12 season, Barcelona lost the semi-finals of the Champions League against Chelsea. Guardiola, who had been on a rolling contract and had faced criticism over his recent tactics and squad selections,[131][132] announced that he would step down as manager on 30 June and be succeeded by assistant Tito Vilanova.[133][134] Guardiola finished his tenure with Barça winning the Copa del Rey final 3–0, bringing the tally to 14 trophies that Barça had won under his coaching.[135]\\n\\nIt was announced in summer of 2012 that Tito Vilanova, assistant manager at Barcelona, would take over from Pep Guardiola as manager.[136] Following his appointment, Barcelona went on an incredible run that saw them hold the top spot on the league table for the entire season, recording only two losses and amassing 100 points. Their top scorer once again was Lionel Messi, who scored 46 goals in La Liga, including two hat-tricks. On 11 May 2013, Barcelona were crowned as the Spanish football champions for the 22nd time, still with four games left to play. Ultimately, Barcelona ended the season 15 points clear of rivals Real Madrid, despite losing 2–1 to them at the beginning of March.[137] They reached the semi-final stage of both the Copa del Rey and the Champions League, going out to Real Madrid and Bayern Munich respectively. On 19 July, it was announced that Vilanova was resigning as Barcelona manager because his throat cancer had returned, and he would be receiving treatment for the second time after a three-month medical leave in December 2012.[138]\\n\\n2014–2020: Bartomeu era\\n\\nLuis Suárez joined the club in 2014. Messi, Suárez and Neymar, dubbed \"MSN\", formed a record-breaking strike force.\\nOn 22 July 2013, Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino was confirmed as manager of Barcelona for the 2013–14 season.[139] Barcelona won the 2013 Supercopa de España 1–1 on away goals.[140] On 23 January 2014, Sandro Rosell resigned as president by the admissibility of a complaint for alleged misappropriation following the transfer of Neymar.[141] Josep Maria Bartomeu replaced him to finish the term.[142]\\n\\nBarcelona won the treble in the 2014–15 season, winning La Liga, Copa del Rey and Champions League titles, and became the first European team to have won the treble twice.[143] On 17 May, the club clinched their 23rd La Liga title after defeating Atlético Madrid.[144] This was Barcelona\\'s seventh La Liga title in the last ten years.[145] On 30 May, the club defeated Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final at Camp Nou.[146] On 6 June, Barcelona won the 2015 Champions League Final with a 3–1 win against Juventus, which completed the treble, the club\\'s second in six years.[147] Barcelona\\'s attacking trio of Messi, Suárez and Neymar, dubbed \"MSN\", scored 122 goals in all competitions, the most in a season for an attacking trio in Spanish football history.[148]\\n\\nOn 11 August, Barcelona started the 2015–16 season winning a joint record fifth European Super Cup by beating Sevilla 5–4 in the 2015 UEFA Super Cup. They ended the year with a 3–0 win over Argentine club River Plate in the 2015 Club World Cup final on 20 December to win the trophy for a record third time, with Suárez, Messi and Iniesta the top three players of the tournament.[149] The Club World Cup was Barcelona\\'s 20th international title, a record only matched by Egyptian club Al Ahly.[150][151] By scoring 180 goals in 2015 in all competitions, Barcelona set the record for most goals scored in a calendar year, breaking Real Madrid\\'s record of 178 goals scored in 2014.[152] On 10 February 2016, qualifying for the sixth Copa del Rey final in the last eight seasons, Luis Enrique\\'s Barcelona broke the club\\'s record of 28 consecutive games unbeaten in all competitions set by Guardiola\\'s team in the 2010–11 season, with a 1–1 draw with Valencia in the second leg of the 2015–16 Copa del Rey.[153][154] With a 5–1 win at Rayo Vallecano on 3 March, Barcelona\\'s 35th match unbeaten, the club broke Real Madrid\\'s Spanish record of 34 games unbeaten in all competitions from the 1988–1989 season.[155][156] After Barça reached 39 matches unbeaten, their run ended on 2 April 2016 with a 2–1 defeat to Real Madrid at Camp Nou.[157] On 14 May 2016, Barcelona won their sixth La Liga title in eight seasons.[158] The front three of Messi, Suárez and Neymar finished the season with 131 goals, breaking the record they had set the previous year for most goals by an attacking trio in a single season.[159]\\n\\nOn 8 March 2017, Barcelona made the largest comeback in Champions League history in the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League Round of 16 second Leg, defeating Paris Saint-Germain 6–1 (aggregate score 6–5), despite losing the first leg in France by a score of 4–0.[160] On 29 May 2017, former player Ernesto Valverde was named as Luis Enrique\\'s successor.[161] On 20 September 2017, Barcelona issued a statement exercising their stance on the 2017 Catalan referendum saying, \"FC Barcelona, in holding the utmost respect for its diverse body of members, will continue to support the will of the majority of Catalan people, and will do so in a civil, peaceful, and exemplary way\".[162] The match against UD Las Palmas on the referendum day was requested to be postponed by the Barcelona board due to heavy violence in Catalonia, but it (the request) was declined by La Liga, therefore being held behind closed doors.[163] Two directors, Jordi Monés and Carles Vilarrubí, handed in their resignations in protest at the game\\'s being played.[164] Winning La Liga for the 2017–18 season, on 9 May 2018, Barcelona defeated Villarreal 5–1 to set the longest unbeaten streak (43 games) in La Liga history.[165] On 27 April 2019, Barcelona won their 26th La Liga title.[166] However, the La Liga title was overshadowed by an improbable Champions League exit to Liverpool in the semi-finals, with Barça losing the second leg 0–4 after being up 3–0 after a home victory.[167]\\n\\nOn 13 January 2020, following the loss to Atlético Madrid in the Spanish Supercup, former Real Betis coach Quique Setién replaced Ernesto Valverde as the new head coach of Barcelona.[168] Ultimately Barcelona finished the season trophyless for first time in 12 years. On 17 August, the club confirmed that Setién had been removed from his position as manager with director of football Eric Abidal also dismissed from his position.[169] Two days later, Ronald Koeman was appointed as the new head coach of Barcelona.[170] Rising dissatisfaction among supporters due to worsening finances and decline on the pitch in the previous season led to Josep Maria Bartomeu announcing his resignation as president on 27 October 2020, to avoid facing a vote of no confidence from the club members.[171][172]\\n\\n2021–present: Return of Laporta and post-Messi era\\n\\nChart of Barcelona\\'s league performance 1929–2023\\nOn 7 March 2021, Joan Laporta was elected president of Barcelona with 54.28% of the vote.[173] Barcelona won their 31st Copa del Rey, their only trophy under Ronald Koeman, after defeating Athletic Bilbao 4–0 in the final.[174] In August 2021 Barcelona found themselves unable to comply with La Liga\\'s Financial Fair Play requirements, and revealed a club debt of €1.35bn and a wage bill accounting for 103% of total income. Negotiations with Lionel Messi, now in the final year of his contract, had been ongoing for some time. However, on 5 August 2021, Barcelona announced that they would be unable to re-sign Messi to an extension due to La Liga regulations. This was despite the fact that the club and Messi had reached an agreement over the details of a new contract. Messi departed the club after 21 years as a Barça player, and the club\\'s all-time leading goalscorer, and signed on a free transfer with French club Paris Saint-Germain.[175][176] The financial implications also restricted Barcelona in the transfer market and as a result most of the incoming players were either free transfers or loans and they had to reduce players\\' wages to register the incoming players.[177]\\n\\nPoor performances in La Liga and the Champions League led to the sacking of Ronald Koeman on 28 October, with a club legend Xavi replacing him.[178][179] Xavi could not reverse the fortunes in the Champions League, and Barcelona dropped down to the Europa League for the first time since 2003–04, subsequently exiting in the quarter-finals.[180] In the domestic league, Xavi improved Barça\\'s form and guided them from ninth to second, guaranteeing a Champions League spot next season. However, this also meant Barcelona finished trophyless after earlier Supercopa and Copa del Rey exits.[181]\\n\\nOn 15 January 2023, Xavi guided Barcelona to their first trophy since the 2021 Copa del Rey, as the Catalans defeated Real Madrid 3–1 in the Supercopa de España final.[182] On 14 May 2023, Barcelona mathematically clinched their 27th league title with four games to spare, the first in the post-Messi era.[183]\\n\\nSupport\\nMain article: Supporters of FC Barcelona\\n\\nTifo at Camp Nou in a 2013 comeback against AC Milan\\nThe nickname culer for a Barcelona supporter is derived from the Catalan cul (English: arse), as the spectators at the first stadium, Camp de la Indústria, sat with their culs over the stand.[184][185] In Spain, about 25% of the population is said to be Barça sympathisers, second behind Real Madrid, supported by 32% of the population.[186] Throughout Europe, Barcelona is the favourite second-choice club.[187] The club\\'s membership figures have seen a significant increase from 100,000 in the 2003–04 season to 170,000 in September 2009,[188] the sharp rise being attributed to the influence of Ronaldinho and then-president Joan Laporta\\'s media strategy that focused on Spanish and English online media.[189][190] As of 31 May 2023, the club has 150,317 memberships, called socis.[191]\\n\\nIn addition to membership, as of March 2022 there are 1,264 officially registered fan clubs, called penyes, around the world.[192] The fan clubs promote Barcelona in their locality and receive beneficial offers when visiting Barcelona.[193] Among the best supported teams globally, Barcelona has the second highest social media following in the world among sports teams, with over 103 million Facebook fans as of December 2021, only behind Real Madrid with 111 million.[12][194] The club has had many prominent people among its supporters, including Pope John Paul II, who was an honorary member, and former prime minister of Spain José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero.[195][196]\\n\\nClub rivalries\\nEl Clásico\\nMain article: El Clásico\\n\\nPlayers jostle in Barcelona\\'s 2–6 win against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in a 2009 El Clásico.\\nThere is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Barcelona and Real Madrid is known as \"The Classic\" (El Clásico). From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Catalonia and Castile, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between Catalans and the Castilians, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.[197] Over the years, the head-to-head record between the two clubs is 102 victories for Madrid, 100 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws.[198]\\n\\n\\nBarcelona fans creating a mosaic of the Catalan flag before a 2012 El Clasico at Camp Nou\\nAs early as the 1930s, Barcelona \"had developed a reputation as a symbol of Catalan identity, opposed to the centralising tendencies of Madrid\".[199][200] In 1936, when Francisco Franco started the Coup d\\'état against the democratic Second Spanish Republic, the president of Barcelona, Josep Sunyol, member of the Republican Left of Catalonia and Deputy to The Cortes, was arrested and executed without trial by Franco\\'s troops[201] (Sunyol was exercising his political activities, visiting Republican troops north of Madrid).[199] During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera and especially Francisco Franco, all regional languages and identities in Spain were frowned upon and restrained. As such, most citizens of Barcelona were in strong opposition to the fascist-like regime. In this period, Barcelona gained their motto Més que un club (English: More than a club) because of its alleged connection to Catalan nationalist as well as to progressive beliefs.[202]\\n\\nThere\\'s an ongoing controversy as to what extent Franco\\'s rule (1939–75) influenced the activities and on-pitch results of both Barcelona and Real Madrid. Fans of both clubs tend to exaggerate the myths favouring their narratives. Most historians agree than Franco did not have a preferred football team, but his Spanish nationalist beliefs led him to associate himself with the establishment teams, such as Atlético Aviación and Madrid FC (that recovered its royal name after the fall of the Republic). On the other hand, he also wanted the renamed CF Barcelona succeed as \"Spanish team\" rather than a Catalan one. During the early years of Franco\\'s rule, Real Madrid were not particularly successful, winning two Copa del Generalísimo titles and a Copa Eva Duarte; Barcelona claimed three league titles, one Copa del Generalísimo and one Copa Eva Duarte. During that period, Atlético Aviación were believed to be the preferred team over Real Madrid. The most contested stories of the period include Real Madrid\\'s 11–1 home win against Barcelona in the Copa del Generalísimo, where the Catalan team alleged intimidation, and the controversial transfer of Alfredo Di Stéfano to Real Madrid despite his agreement with Barcelona. The latter transfer was part of Real Madrid chairman Santiago Bernabéu\\'s \"revolution\" that ushered in the era of unprecedented dominance. Bernabéu, himself a veteran of the Civil War who fought for Franco\\'s forces, saw Real Madrid on top not only of Spanish but also European football, helping create the European Cup, the first true competition for Europe\\'s best club sides. His vision was fulfilled when Real Madrid not only started winning consecutive league titles but also swept the first five editions of the European Cup in the 1950s.[203] These events had a profound impact on Spanish football and influenced Franco\\'s attitude. According to historians, during this time he realized the importance of Real Madrid for his regime\\'s international image, and the club became his preferred team until his death. Fernando Maria Castiella, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs under Franco from 1957 until 1969, noted that \"[Real Madrid] is the best embassy we have ever had.\" Franco died in 1975, and the Spanish transition to democracy soon followed. Under his rule, Real Madrid had won 14 league titles, 6 Copa del Generalísimo titles, 1 Copa Eva Duarte, 6 European Cups, 2 Latin Cups, and 1 Intercontinental Cup. In the same period, Barcelona had won 8 league titles, 9 Copa del Generalísimo titles, 3 Copa Eva Duarte titles, 3 Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, and 2 Latin Cups.[204][205]\\n\\nThe rivalry was intensified during the 1950s when the clubs disputed the signing of Alfredo Di Stéfano. Di Stéfano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for Los Millionarios in Bogotá, Colombia, during a players\\' strike in his native Argentina. Soon after Millonarios\\' return to Colombia, Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team to have held Di Stéfano\\'s rights, for his transfer in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian lira (according to other sources 200,000 dollars). This started a battle between the two Spanish rivals for his rights. FIFA appointed Armando Muñoz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football Federation as mediator. Calero decided to let Di Stéfano play the 1953–54 and 1955–56 seasons in Madrid, and the 1954–55 and 1956–57 seasons in Barcelona. The agreement was approved by the Football Association and their respective clubs. Although the Catalans agreed, the decision created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president was forced to resign in September 1953. Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di Stéfano moved to Los Blancos, signing a four-year contract. Real paid 5.5 million Spanish pesetas for the transfer, plus a 1.3 million bonus for the purchase, an annual fee to be paid to the Millonarios, and a 16,000 salary for Di Stéfano with a bonus double that of his teammates, for a total of 40% of the annual revenue of the Madrid club.[206]\\n\\nDi Stéfano became integral in the subsequent success achieved by Real Madrid, scoring twice in his first game against Barcelona. With him, Madrid won the first five editions of the European Cup.[207] The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when Real Madrid and Barcelona met twice in the European Cup, with Madrid triumphing en route to their fifth consecutive title in 1959–60 and Barcelona prevailing en route to losing the final in 1960–61. In 2002, the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the \"Match of The Century\" by Spanish media, and Madrid\\'s win was watched by more than 500 million people.[208] An intense fixture which is marked by its indiscipline in addition to memorable goal celebrations from both teams – often involving mocking the opposition – such notable celebrations occurred in 2009 when Barcelona captain Carles Puyol kissed his Catalan armband in front of incensed Madrid fans at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium and in 2017 when Lionel Messi celebrated his 93rd-minute winner for Barcelona against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu by taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans – with his name and number facing them.[209]\\n\\nEl derbi Barceloní\\nMain article: Derbi Barceloní\\n\\nBarcelona players parade La Liga trophy around Camp Nou in May 2006 after defeating Espanyol in their last home game of the season.\\nBarça\\'s local rival has always been Espanyol. Blanc-i-blaus, being one of the clubs granted royal patronage, was founded exclusively by Spanish football fans, unlike the multinational nature of Barça\\'s primary board. The founding message of the club was clearly anti-Barcelona, and they disapprovingly saw FC Barcelona as a team of foreigners.[210] The rivalry was strengthened by what Catalonians saw as a provocative representative of Madrid.[211] Their original ground was in the affluent district of Sarrià.[212][213]\\n\\nTraditionally, Espanyol was seen by the vast majority of Barcelona\\'s citizens as a club which cultivated a kind of compliance to the central authority, in stark contrast to Barça\\'s revolutionary spirit.[214] Also in the 1960s and 1970s, while FC Barcelona acted as an integrating force for Catalonia\\'s new arrivals from poorer regions of Spain expecting to find a better life, Espanyol drew their support mainly from sectors close to the regime such as policemen, military officers, civil servants and career fascists.[215]\\n\\nIn 1918, Espanyol started a counter-petition against autonomy, which at that time had become a pertinent issue.[210] Later on, an Espanyol supporter group would join the Falangists in the Spanish Civil War, siding with the fascists. Despite these differences in ideology, the derbi has always been more relevant to Espanyol supporters than Barcelona ones due to the difference in objectives. In recent years the rivalry has become less political, as Espanyol translated its official name and anthem from Spanish to Catalan.[210]\\n\\nThough it is the most played local derby in the history of La Liga, it is also the most unbalanced, with Barcelona overwhelmingly dominant. In the primera división league table, Espanyol has only managed to end above Barça on three occasions from 87 seasons (1928–2022) and the only all-Catalan Copa del Rey final was won by Barça in 1957. Espanyol has the consolation of achieving the largest margin win with a 6–0 in 1951, while Barcelona\\'s biggest win was 5–0 on seven occasions (in 1933, 1947, 1964, 1975, 1992, 2016 and 2017). Espanyol achieved a 2–1 win against Barça during the 2008–09 season, becoming the first team to defeat Barcelona at Camp Nou in their treble-winning season.[216]\\n\\nRivalry with AC Milan\\n\\nBarcelona\\'s ultras Boixos Nois in the 2005–06 UEFA Champions League semi-final against AC Milan at San Siro\\nOne of Barcelona\\'s rivals in European football is Italian club AC Milan.[217][218][219][220] The team against which Barcelona has played the most matches (19), it is also the third most played match in European club competitions, behind Real Madrid–Juventus (21) and Real Madrid–Bayern Munich (26).[221][222][223] Two of the most successful clubs in Europe, Milan has won seven European Cups to Barça\\'s five, while both clubs have won a record five European Super Cups.[224] Barcelona and Milan have won other continental titles, which make them the second and third most decorated teams in world football, with 19 and 14 titles respectively, both behind Real Madrid\\'s 23.[225]\\n\\nBarcelona leads the head-to-head record with eight wins and five defeats. The first encounter between the two clubs was in the 1959–60 European Cup. They faced off in the round of 16 and Barça won the tie on a 7–1 aggregate score (0–2 in Milan and 5–1 in Barcelona).[226] While Milan had never knocked Barcelona out of the European Cup, they beat Johan Cruyff\\'s Dream Team 4–0 in the 1994 Champions League final, despite being the underdogs.[227][228] In 2013, however, Barcelona made a \"historic\" comeback from a 0–2 first leg defeat in the round of 16 of the 2012–13 Champions League, winning 4–0 at Camp Nou.[229][230]\\n\\nOwnership and finances\\n\\nCivil Guards at the socis\\' entrance of the Camp de la Indústria\\nAlong with Real Madrid, Athletic Bilbao, and Osasuna, Barcelona is organised as a registered association.[231][232] Unlike a limited company, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only membership.[233] The members of Barcelona, called socis, form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club.[234] As of 31 May 2023, the club has 150,317 socis.[191]\\n\\nIn 2010, Forbes evaluated Barcelona\\'s worth to be around €752 million (US$1 billion), ranking them fourth after Manchester United, Real Madrid and Arsenal, based on figures from the 2008–09 season.[235][236] According to Deloitte, Barcelona had a recorded revenue of €366 million in the same period, ranking second to Real Madrid, who generated €401 million in revenue.[237] In 2013, Forbes magazine ranked Barcelona the third most valuable sports team in the world, behind Real Madrid and Manchester United, with a value of $2.6 billion.[238] In 2014, Forbes ranked them the second most valuable sports team in the world, worth $3.2 billion, and Deloitte ranked them the world\\'s fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €484.6 million.[239][240] In 2017, Forbes ranked them the fourth most valuable sports team in the world with a team value of $3.64 billion.[241] In 2018, Barcelona became the first sports team to surpass $1bn in annual revenues.[242] In November 2018 Barcelona became the first sports team with average first-team pay in excess of £10m ($13.8m) per year.[243][244] However, years of profligate spending under the leadership of Josep Maria Bartomeu (president between 2014 and 2020) and other factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, saw the club\\'s gross debt rise to about $1.4 billion in 2021, much of it short-term.[242]\\n\\nOn November 9, 2024, Barcelona announced its new sponsorship deal with Nike. It is said that it is the highest deal in football history.[245]\\n\\nIn popular culture\\nSince its origins, Barcelona has had a close relationship with the world of culture, especially, with Catalan culture.[246][247][248] The club\\'s statutes from 1932 already said that Barça \"is an association of a cultural and sporting nature\".[249] The club and its players have been a source of inspiration for writers, musicians, visual artists, journalists, cartoonists, theater, and film people.[250][251]\\n\\nIn literature, some great Catalan writers they were inspired by the club. In 1957, on the occasion of the inauguration of the Camp Nou, Josep Maria de Sagarra dedicated a poem titled Blau i grana.[252] Poet Manuel Vázquez Montalbán wrote regularly about his vision of the team. Some expressions emerged that caught on in the popular imagination, such as identifying Barça with \"The unarmed army of Catalonia.\" He also wrote that \"Barça is the only legal institution that unites the man on the street with the Catalonia that could have been and was not.\"[253][254]\\n\\nThe great anniversaries have been favorable occasions for the club to involve great Catalan figures from the cultural world in its activities. Names such as Josep Segrelles, Joan Miró and Antoni Tàpies have signed commemorative posters, just as Jaume Picas and the writer Josep Maria Espinàs, on the occasion of the club\\'s 75th anniversary, wrote the lyrics for Cant del Barça, the current anthem, with music by Manuel Valls.[255][256]\\n\\n\\nFollow my dreams mural by Italian street artist TVBoy, this mural features Barcelona Femení player Alexia Putellas\\nThe Blaugrana world has also been a source of inspiration in the plastic arts, with names such as Jordi Alumà, Josep Maria Subirachs, Antoni Tàpies or Josep Viladomat, who made the \\'Avi del Barça\\' sculpture in the La Masia.[257] Salvador Dalí paid tribute to the club\\'s 75th anniversary with an etching.[258]\\n\\nIn performing arts, music has also been present, from the tango that Gardel dedicated to Samitier to the songs of Joan Manuel Serrat, La Trinca and many others. Theater has also been a good way to express the feelings of Barça fans, from the El Paralelo cuplés from before the Civil War or skits like \\'El Partido del Domingo\\', by Castaños, to more recent texts, like El culékulé, by Xavier Bosch.[259]\\n\\nIn times of political difficulty or lack of freedoms, Barça has been a refuge and means of expression for cultural and artistic activities. In 2013, the club highlighted the \\'Barça Cultura\\' plan, an initiative that promotes the area of institutional relations and protocol with the aim of offering Barcelona as a platform to promote culture in Catalonia.[260] In 2022, Barcelona and Òmnium sign an agreement to promote the Catalan language, culture and the country.[261]\\n\\nThere are many documentaries and films that have been created throughout history to capture the successes and journey of the club over the years. More recently, in December 2022, Amazon Prime Video released a five-episode docuseries called FC Barcelona: A New Era.[262] It documented the club by spending time with the coaching staff and players behind the scenes both on and off the field throughout their 2021–22 season. In September 2023, Amazon Prime Video launched the second season with a five-episode docuseries. It focuses on their 2022–23 behind the scenes season.[263]\\n\\nRecords\\nFurther information: List of FC Barcelona records and statistics\\n\\nXavi made 767 total appearances for Barcelona, a former club record.\\nIn March 2021, Lionel Messi overtook Xavi\\'s record of 767 games played for the club, and presently has made 778 official appearances in all competitions, while also holding the record for the most appearances in La Liga matches for Barcelona, with 520.[264]\\n\\n\\nLionel Messi is Barcelona\\'s all-time top appearance maker, top scorer, and the highest scoring player for a single club.\\nBarcelona\\'s all-time highest goalscorer in official competitions is Lionel Messi with 672 goals, surpassing César Rodríguez\\'s 232 goals in March 2012, a record which stood for 60 years.[265] In December 2020, Messi also overtook Pelé\\'s 643 goals for Santos to become the highest official scorer for a single club.[266] Messi is the record goalscorer for Barcelona in European and international club competitions,[267] and the record league scorer with 474 goals in La Liga.[268] Four other players have managed to score over 100 league goals for Barcelona: César Rodríguez (190), Luis Suárez (147), László Kubala (131) and Samuel Eto\\'o (108).[269] Josep Samitier is the club\\'s highest goalscorer in the Copa del Rey, with 64 goals.[270]\\n\\nLászló Kubala holds the La Liga record for most goals scored in one match, with seven goals against Sporting Gijón in 1952.[271] Lionel Messi co-holds the Champions League record with five goals against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012.[272] Eulogio Martínez became Barça\\'s top goalscorer in a cup game, when he scored seven goals against Atlético Madrid in 1957.[267]\\n\\nBarcelona goalkeepers have won a record number of Zamora trophies (20), with Antoni Ramallets and Víctor Valdés winning a record five each. Valdés had a ratio of 0.832 goals-conceded-per-game, a La Liga record,[273] and he also holds the record for longest period without conceding a goal (896 minutes) in all competitions for Barcelona.[274] Claudio Bravo has the record of best unbeaten start in a season in La Liga history, at 754 minutes.[275][276]\\n\\n\\nPep Guardiola is Barcelona\\'s most successful coach, with 14 trophies.\\nBarcelona\\'s longest serving manager is Jack Greenwell, with nine years in two spells (1917–1924) and (1931–1933), and Pep Guardiola is the club\\'s most successful manager (14 trophies in 4 years). The most successful Barcelona player is Lionel Messi with 35 trophies, surpassing Andrés Iniesta, with 32 trophies.[277]\\n\\nBarcelona\\'s Camp Nou is the largest stadium in Europe. The club\\'s highest home attendance was 120,000 in a European Cup quarter-final against Juventus on 3 March 1986.[278] The modernisation of Camp Nou during the 1990s and the introduction of all-seater stands means the record will not be broken for the foreseeable future as the current capacity of the stadium is 99,354.[279]\\n\\nEl Barça de les Cinc Copes is the first team in Spanish football to have won five trophies in a single season (1951–1952).[280][281][282] Barcelona is the only club to have played in every season of European competitions since they started in 1955 counting non-UEFA competition Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.[283][284] On 18 December 2009, alongside being the only Spanish club to achieve a continental treble, Barcelona became the first ever European football team to win six trophies in a calendar year (Sextuple).[285][286] In January 2018, Barcelona signed Philippe Coutinho from Liverpool for €120 million, the highest transfer fee in club\\'s history.[287][288] In August 2017, Barcelona player Neymar transferred to Paris Saint-Germain for a world record transfer fee of €222 million.[289][290]\\n\\nIn 2016, Barcelona\\'s La Masia was ranked second by the International Centre for Sports Studies (CIES) as the most top-level players producing academy in the world.[291]\\n\\nKits and crest\\n\\nWikimedia Commons has media related to FC Barcelona kits.\\n\\n\\nThe first crest (left) worn by Barça from 1899 to 1910, and second crest (right), designed by Carles Comamala in 1910.\\nThe club\\'s original crest was a quartered diamond-shaped crest topped by the Crown of Aragon and the bat of King James, and surrounded by two branches, one of a laurel tree and the other a palm.[32] The club shared Barcelona\\'s coat of arms, as a demonstration of its identification with the city and a desire to be recognised as one.[292] In 1910, the club held a competition among its members to design a new crest. The winner was Carles Comamala, who at the time played for the club. Comamala\\'s suggestion became the crest that the club wears today, with some minor variations. The crest consists of the St George Cross in the upper-left corner with the Catalan flag beside it, and the team colours at the bottom.[293]\\n\\nThe blue and garnet colours of the shirt were first worn in a match against Hispania in 1900.[294] Several competing theories have been put forth for the blue and garnet design of the Barcelona shirt. The son of the first president, Arthur Witty, claimed it was the idea of his father as the colours were the same as the Merchant Taylor\\'s School team. Another explanation, according to author Toni Strubell, is that the colours are from Robespierre\\'s First Republic. In Catalonia the common perception is that the colours were chosen by Joan Gamper and are those of his home team, FC Basel.[295][296]\\n\\n\\n1899–1910[n1 1]\\n\\n1910–present[n1 2]\\n\\n2015–16[n1 3]\\n\\n2019–20[n1 4]\\n\\n2021–22[n1 5]\\nNotes\\n The first kit worn by the club in 1899.[297] In the 1999–2000 season, a similar model was worn to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the club and 2024–25 season with an original model.[298]\\n Traditional Barcelona uniform.[299]\\n The club used horizontal stripes during the 2015–16 season.[300]\\n The club used a checkered design during the 2019–20 season.[301]\\n The club used halved shorts and a crest-inspired shirt during the 2021–22 season.[302]\\nKit suppliers and shirt sponsors\\nSince 1998, the club has had a kit deal with Nike.
