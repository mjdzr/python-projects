Paris Saint-Germain Football Club, commonly referred to as Paris Saint-Germain (French: [paʁi sɛ̃ʒɛʁmɛ̃]) or simply PSG, is a professional football club based in Paris, France. They compete in Ligue 1, the top division of French football.

Founded in 1970, following the merger of Paris FC and Stade Saint-Germain, PSG have the most consecutive seasons playing in France's top flight. They are the most popular football club in France and one of the most widely supported teams in the world. They are nicknamed the Les Rouge-et-Bleu (The Red-and-Blues), for the shirt colour that also includes white, and their crest features the Eiffel Tower and a fleur-de-lis. The team has a longstanding rivalry with Marseille, against whom they contest Le Classique. PSG have played their home matches in the 48,000-capacity Parc des Princes in Paris since 1973, located in the 16th arrondissement of Paris near the Boulogne-Billancourt commune.

They won their first major honour, the French Cup, in 1982 and their first Division 1 title in 1986. The 1990s was among the most successful periods in the club's history. After suffering a decline in fortunes during the 2000s, the Red and Blues have enjoyed a revival since 2011 when they were taken over by Qatar Sports Investments. With considerable financial investment, allowing the club to buy superstar players such as Zlatan Ibrahimović, Edinson Cavani and Neymar, the team has achieved unparalleled dominance in domestic competitions, winning multiple league titles and national cups and became a regular feature in the UEFA Champions League.

With 51 major trophies won, PSG are the most decorated club in France. They have won 49 domestic trophies: a record 13 Ligue 1 titles, a record 15 Coupe de France, a record 9 Coupe de la Ligue, and record 13 Trophée des Champions. Internationally, they won the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1996 – unique feat in French football – and were runners-up in 1997, making them one of two French clubs to have won a major European title. They also won the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2001 and were runners-up in the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League.

Since 2011, PSG have been majority-owned by Qatari government-backed investment fund Qatar Sports Investments, which currently holds 87.5% of the shares. American investment firm Arctos Partners owns the remaining 12.5%. PSG are the richest club in France and one of the wealthiest in the world. PSG currently have the third-highest revenue in the footballing world with annual earnings of €806m according to Deloitte, and are the world's seventh-most valuable football club, worth $4.4bn according to Forbes.

History
Main article: History of Paris Saint-Germain FC
Creation and split (1970–1973)

Guy Crescent (pictured), Pierre-Étienne Guyot and Henri Patrelle founded PSG in 1970.
In the summer of 1970, an ambitious group of businessmen decided to create a major team in the French capital.[1][2] Guy Crescent and Pierre-Étienne Guyot chose to merge their virtual side, Paris FC, created in 1969, with Stade Saint-Germain of Henri Patrelle after the team from Saint-Germain-en-Laye, 15 km west of Paris and founded in 1904, won promotion to Division 2.[1][2][3] However, the three men were stuck with the financial feasibility of the project until they met Real Madrid president Santiago Bernabéu.[4][5] He told them that starting a crowdfunding campaign was the best solution to establish a new team. 20,000 people backed the project and Paris Saint-Germain were formed on 17 June 1970.[4] Guyot was elected the club's first president a few days later.[1][6][7] For the first time in French football history, the fans had financially contributed in the making of a club.[8] The merger was made official following the creation of the club's association on 12 August 1970.[6] PSG retains this day as their foundation date.[1]

Paris FC contributed with the financial backing, while Stade Saint-Germain provided the sporting infrastructure, from the Division 2 status to the Camp des Loges training center, as well as the manager Pierre Phelipon and most of the players, including Bernard Guignedoux, Michel Prost and Camille Choquier.[9] PSG further strengthened their squad with the signing of Jean Djorkaeff, captain of the French national team.[10] PSG's first official game was a 1–1 league draw away to Poitiers on 23 August 1970. Guignedoux scored the club's first ever goal from a free-kick.[11] The club went on to clinch promotion to Division 1 and claim the Division 2 title in its inaugural season.[2][12]

PSG's first top-flight season ended with a safe 16th place, meaning they would stay in Division 1 next year, but behind the scenes the club was in a delicate financial situation.[9][13] Back in September 1971, the Paris City Council offered 850k francs to pay the club's debt and save its place in the elite, demanding PSG in return to adopt the more Parisian name "Paris Football Club."[9][14] Crescent, who had replaced Guyot as club president before the start of the season, was in favor of the name change, but Patrelle was against it.[3][15] The disagreement led to Crescent's resignation in December 1971, handing the presidency to Patrelle.[14] The latter tried to persuade the council to reconsider their position, but they remained inflexible and the club split on 1 June 1972, a few days after the last match of the campaign.[9][14][16] Backed by the council, Crescent re-formed Paris FC and remained in Division 1, while the PSG of Patrelle were administratively relegated to Division 3, thus losing professional status.[3][9][10]

Top-flight return and Parc des Princes move (1973–1978)

Just Fontaine helped Paris Saint-Germain return to Division 1 in 1974.
Paris Saint-Germain really took flight with the arrival of fashion designer Daniel Hechter as chairman of the management committee in June 1973.[1][17] Besides offering his financial support to the club, he also designed the team's classic home outfit.[13][18] Hechter then shocked the national game ahead of 1973–74 by appointing French legend Just Fontaine as sporting director.[9][10]

Robert Vicot's men finished second in Group B, four points behind Red Star, qualifying for the promotion play–offs against Valenciennes. PSG lost 1–2 away to Valenciennes, but PSG recorded an incredible 4–2 comeback at the Parc des Princes, thus achieving promotion to Division 1 and regaining its professional status abandoned two years earlier.[9][19] Overwhelmed by emotion, Fontaine collapsed on the lawn and was then carried by the players in celebration.[19][20] Since then, PSG have always played in the first tier of French football.[19]

PSG played their first game at the Parc des Princes during this campaign. It was against fellow Parisian side Red Star on 10 November 1973. PSG won 3–1 and Othniel Dossevi scored the club's first goal at the stadium.[21] The Parisians also began their tradition of brilliant Coupe de France runs, reaching the quarterfinals after beating Metz at the Parc in front of 25,000 spectators (2–1; 4–1 on aggregate).[22]

In an ironic turn of events, Paris FC were relegated to Division 2 at the same time as Paris Saint-Germain moved up to the top flight in 1974, leaving their home stadium, the Parc des Princes, in the hands of their estranged Parisian brothers. Since then, the Parc has been the home of PSG.[9][16] With promotion to Division 1 also came a change of command. Daniel Hechter, then chairman of the management committee, took over as club president in June 1974 following the resignation of Patrelle.[17][23] He named Francis Borelli as vice-president.[18][22]

Under Hechter's tenure, the Parisians failed to win any silverware in the 1970s but began their tradition of brilliant Coupe de France runs, established themselves in Division 1, and attracted several prestigious players, including Jean-Pierre Dogliani, Mustapha Dahleb and Carlos Bianchi.[9][10] After Hechter was banned for life from football by the French Football Federation in January 1978, for running a ticketing scheme at the Parc des Princes, Francis Borelli, who had been vice-president until then, became the new boss of the Île-de-France club.[9][18][22]

First major honours and decline (1978–1991)
Following the arrival of manager Georges Peyroche in November 1979,[24] the club established itself as a top-half team and then welcomed its first major honour when the Parisians reached their first French Cup final in 1982.[13][25][26][27] Up against the great Saint-Étienne of Michel Platini at the Parc des Princes, Nambatingue Toko opened the scoring for PSG following a good cross from Ivica Šurjak. Saint-Étienne reacted and Platini equalized to send the game to extra-time. Platini then doubled his personal account, giving the Greens the lead.[20][21][28] The Parc des Princes faithful no longer believed in their team when Dominique Rocheteau, after yet another assist from Šurjak, scored an unexpected equalizer in the last seconds of the match.[20][21] PSG fans invaded the field in joy, while club president Francis Borelli kneeled and kissed the lawn of the Parc.[20][28] Following an interruption of 30 minutes, the penalty shootout sealed PSG's coronation.[21][28] Dominique Baratelli stopped Saint-Étienne's last attempt and Jean-Marc Pilorget scored the winning penalty for the capital side.[20][28] This success opened the doors to Europe, where PSG made an impressive continental debut in reaching the quarterfinals of the 1982–83 European Cup Winners' Cup.[12][29]


Dominique Rocheteau scored one of the club's most iconic goals ever.
On the domestic scene, results were just as satisfying. PSG captured their first podium finish, coming in third place, and repeated the feat in the 1983 Coupe de France Final, this time against Nantes.[10][30] Recently crowned French champions, the Canaries were headed for the league-cup double, leading at the break after overturning Pascal Zaremba's early strike. But PSG managed their own comeback in the second half as Sušić equalized and then assisted Toko for the winning goal (3–2).[25][29][30] The campaign ended on a sad note, though, as Georges Peyroche left the club.[31]

Three years later, under the guidance of manager Gérard Houllier, PSG claimed their maiden league crown in 1985–86.[10][32] They dominated the championship from start to finish thanks in big part to the likes of Joël Bats, Dominique Bathenay, Luis Fernandez, Dominique Rocheteau and Safet Sušić, all of whom made up the backbone of the team.[9][25] The victory away to Toulouse on Matchday 3 meant PSG sat at the top of the table for the first time ever, a spot they never relinquished, going a memorable 26 matches without defeat towards the title.[9][25][32]

The follow-up to the league title was not as glorious though.[25] Defending champions PSG finished the league in seventh place, suffered an early exit from the French Cup and were knocked out by Czech minnows Vítkovice in the first round of a disappointing European Cup debut.[25][33][34] The following year, PSG avoided relegation on the final match of the 1987–88 season thanks to a dramatic 0–1 win away to Le Havre.[35] Highly indebted, the club briefly bounced back, fighting for the 1988–89 league crown with Marseille, before going into decline.[25][36][37]

Canal+ takeover and golden era (1991–1998)

The takeover by television giants Canal+ in 1991 revitalised Paris Saint-Germain as they became one of the richest clubs in France.[1][18] Canal+ wiped out PSG's huge debt and appointed Michel Denisot, journalist on the channel, as club president in place of Francis Borelli.[18][38] Now enjoying serious investment, the Red and Blues were able to set their sights steadily higher: they had to qualify for European competitions in their first season and become French champions within three years.[9][38] In consequence, Canal+ increased the club's budget from 90 to 120 million francs in order to build a strong squad for the 1991–92 season.[9][38] The revolution began with the appointment of renowned coach Artur Jorge, famous for leading Porto to the 1986–87 European Cup trophy. The club then embarked on a spending spree, signing Brazilian stars Ricardo and Valdo as well as proven French players Paul Le Guen, Laurent Fournier, Patrick Colleter and prolific Liberian striker George Weah.[38]

The 1992–93 season also marked the beginning of Le Classique, the rivalry between Paris Saint-Germain and Marseille, as both teams battled each other on the field for the 1992–93 French Division 1 crown.[38] PSG finished runners-up after losing both games against Marseille.[39][40] In the second match between the two clubs, only three days after winning the 1992–93 UEFA Champions League, league leaders Marseille welcomed closest challengers PSG in a match that would determine the title.[40] After Marseille won their fifth consecutive championship, Bernard Tapie and Marseille were found guilty of match-fixing, in what became known as the French football bribery scandal.[41][42] The French Football Federation stripped Marseille of their title and offered it to second-placed PSG, who refused it because club owners Canal+ thought that claiming the trophy would anger their subscribers back in Marseille.[40][43] As a result, the 1992–93 title remained unattributed, with Canal+ even refusing to let the capital club participate in the following year's UEFA Champions League after UEFA excluded Marseille from the competition. Instead, Monaco, who finished third in Ligue 1, took the Champions League spot.[43]

Considered the club's golden era, the Parisians won nine trophies and reached five consecutive European semi-finals during the 1990s, including their first UEFA Champions League last-four appearance and two at the same stage of the UEFA Cup.[9][12][38] PSG's crowning glory came in the 1996 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final with legend Luis Fernandez now as coach.[44] Bruno Ngotty scored the only goal of the match to defeat Rapid Wien and make Paris the second French club to ever clinch a major European tournament and the youngest club in history to win a European title at 26 years of existence.[45][46] The following season, PSG finished runners-up in the 1996 UEFA Super Cup and 1997 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final.[47][48] On the domestic scene, results were just as satisfying, with Paris celebrating a second league title, three French Cups, two French League Cups and just as many French Super Cup wins.[9][12][38]

Crisis mode and relegation battles (1998–2011)

Club legend Pauleta, who was PSG's all-time top goalscorer, before the QSI takeover
PSG then went into decline following years of mismanagement.[12] In the summer 2000, PSG spent heavily on new players signing Nicolas Anelka, Peter Luccin and Stéphane Dalmat as part of the "PSG Banlieue" project of its shareholder Canal+, with the goal of winning Ligue 1 and performing a solid UEFA Champions League campaign but it was a failure.[12] In 2003, the club faced a massive financial loss with a deficit of €65 million, leading Canal+ to fire Luis Fernandez as coach and Laurent Perpère as president and replacing them with Vahid Halilhodžić, who became the new coach and Francis Graille the new president.[12] The club's form dwindled as they slipped further down the table and eventually, a split from owners Canal+ became inevitable.[9][12]

At the start of the 21st century, PSG struggled to rescale the heights despite the magic of Ronaldinho and the goals of Pauleta.[1] Five more trophies arrived in the form of three French Cups (including one against Le Classique arch-rivals Marseille in 2006), one French League Cup and one UEFA Intertoto Cup, but the club became better known for lurching from one high-profile crisis to another.[12][49][50]

The French premium television channel sold the club to Colony Capital in 2006. The situation, however, only got worse and PSG spent the 2006–07 and 2007–08 campaigns staving off relegations.[9][12] The latter was the most dramatic. Marred by poor results and fan violence, Paris avoided the drop on the final match after a 2–1 win at Sochaux. The hero was Ivorian striker Amara Diané who scored both goals that night. Despite not enjoying the star status of other current or past PSG greats, Diané is still considered a legend by most Parisian fans.[8]

QSI ownership and domestic dominance (2011–present)
After two years of solid progress and stability under the stewardship of manager Antoine Kombouaré and president Robin Leproux, the fortunes of Paris Saint-Germain changed dramatically when Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) purchased the club in 2011.[12] The takeover made PSG not only the richest club in France but one of the wealthiest in the world.[51] Club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi pledged to form a team capable of winning the UEFA Champions League and making the club France's biggest name.[12][52]


Zlatan Ibrahimović greeting PSG fans in the Eiffel Tower on the day he signed for the club in July 2012
Club legend Leonardo was brought back in as sporting director and oversaw a spending spree in summer 2011 that has so far been unprecedented in Ligue 1 history, including the signings of Blaise Matuidi, Salvatore Sirigu, Maxwell, Kevin Gameiro and Javier Pastore.[12] As a result, the Parisians have dominated French football, despite finishing behind Montpellier in 2011–12, the elusive league crown was finally brought back to Paris in 2012–13 driven by star player Zlatan Ibrahimović, team captain Thiago Silva and manager Carlo Ancelotti.[12][53] During the season, ahead of the winter transfer deadline it was announced that David Beckham signed a five-month deal with the club.[54][55] Ibrahimović's 30-goal haul helped the capital side to its first Ligue 1 title in 19 years, and third overall. They also became a regular in the knockout stages of the Champions League,[56] being eliminated from the UEFA Champions League on away goals by Barcelona in the quarter-finals after drawing both games.[53] Big money signings continued with the arrivals of Edinson Cavani in 2013 for a league record of €64 million,[57] making it the sixth largest transfer in history and David Luiz in 2014 for a £50 million transfer fee, a world-record transfer for a defender.[58][59] Despite the departure of Ancelotti, PSG kept its winning ways under Laurent Blanc. The club secured a maiden domestic treble (Ligue 1, Coupe de la Ligue and Trophée des Champions) in the 2013–14 season, before claiming an unprecedented national quadruple (Ligue 1, Coupe de France, Coupe de la Ligue and Trophée des Champions) twice in a row in 2014–15 and 2015–16, winning the latter with a record-breaking 96 points, becoming the only first French men's team to achieve that feat.[60][61]

Fresh from three consecutive UEFA Europa League titles with Sevilla, Unai Emery was hired by PSG for his European pedigree.[52] But with star player Ibrahimović gone, the club endured a disappointing 2016–17 season.[62][63] Paris were pipped to the Ligue 1 title by Monaco, missing out on top spot for the first time in five years. Meanwhile, in the Champions League, the club suffered several disappointing nights,[56] including "La Remontada" ("The Comeback") against Barcelona, losing 6–1 in the second leg of the round of sixteen, despite winning the first leg in France by a score of 4–0.[64]

In response, PSG signed Neymar for a world-record fee of €222 million and French prodigy Kylian Mbappé on an initial loan, which was made permanent in 2018 in a transfer worth €180 million plus add-ons, making him both the second-most expensive player and most expensive teenager.[65] The capital club reclaimed the Ligue 1 title and also won the Trophée des Champions, the Coupe de la Ligue and the Coupe de France, clinching the domestic quadruple for the third time in four seasons.[66] Despite their massive expenditure, in the Champions League, PSG lost to Real Madrid in the round of 16, leading Unai Emery to leave the club at the end of the season.[67]

In May 2018, Thomas Tuchel signed a two-year contract with PSG[68] and in the 2019–20 season, PSG won the Ligue 1 for the 9th time in their history, despite the season ending prematurely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and also reclaimed the Coupe de France defeating Saint-Étienne in the final and won the last-ever Coupe de la Ligue defeating Lyon in a penalty shootout.[69] In the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, PSG reached the semi-finals for the second time since 1995, after a last minute 2–1 win over Atalanta,[70] before losing to Bayern Munich 1–0 in the final in Lisbon, with former PSG player Kingsley Coman scoring the only goal.[71]


Record Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi, who signed for the club in August 2021
During the 2021 summer transfer season, PSG completed one of the most historic transfer windows in football history, exercising the option to buy Danilo Pereira and signing Achraf Hakimi from Inter Milan for a reported fee of €60 million. In addition, the club registered the free transfers of Georginio Wijnaldum, Sergio Ramos, and Gianluigi Donnarumma.[72][73][74] PSG concluded their transfer window with the signing of one of the greatest players of all time and record Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi, who unexpectedly left Barcelona following the expiration of his contract, and promising defender Nuno Mendes on an initial loan, which was made permanent in 2022.[75][76] Later in the season, PSG went on to reclaim the Ligue 1 title for the record 10th time.[77]

Unsatisfied with the club direction and lack of European success club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi promised changes heading into next season and stated the team would not win the UEFA Champions League as currently constructed.[78] Changes were needed at the club on a very deep level and as such during the pre season for the 2022–23 season the club embarked on an ambitious rebuild, most notably with the hiring of transfer market expert Luís Campos as football advisor.[79]

Colours and mascot
Since their foundation, Paris Saint-Germain have represented both the city of Paris and the nearby royal town of Saint-Germain-en-Laye.[12] As a result, red, blue and white are the club's traditional colours.[80] The red and blue are Parisian colours, a nod to revolutionary figures Lafayette and Jean Sylvain Bailly, and the white is a symbol of French royalty and Saint-Germain-en-Laye.[80][81]

On the club's crest, the Eiffel Tower in red and the blue background represent Paris, while the fleur de lys in white is a hint to the coat of arms of Saint-Germain-en-Laye.[80][81] The fleur de lys is a royal symbol as well and recalls that French King Louis XIV was born in the town.[80] Throughout its history, PSG have brandished several crests, but all of them have featured the club's three historical colours.[82]

Likewise, PSG's most iconic shirts have been predominantly red, blue or white, with the remaining two colours included as well.[83] The club's official mascot, Germain the Lynx, also sports PSG's traditional colours.[81] It was unveiled during the 2010 Tournoi de Paris in commemoration of the club's 40th anniversary, and can be seen entertaining kids in the stands of the Parc des Princes or near the pitch with the players during the warm-up.[84]

Anthems and mottos
Further information: Paris Saint-Germain FC supporters § Anthems and mottos
"Allez Paris!," recorded by Belgian actress and singer Annie Cordy in 1971, was the club's first official anthem. A PSG fan from the start, she was part of an association of hundreds of celebrities who contributed to the foundation of the club in 1970.[85][86] The club's second anthem, "Allez Paris-Saint-Germain!" by Les Parisiens, was recorded in 1977, replacing Cordy's version. The brainchild of historical PSG leader and music producer Charles Talar, he produced and released it under his homonym record label.[87][88][89] The song's chorus became a popular chant among PSG supporters during games.[90] A new version, also called "Allez Paris-Saint-Germain!", was recorded in 2010 as part of the club's 40th anniversary celebrations. Sung to the tune of "Go West" by Village People, the lyrics were rewritten with suggestions made by fans. This is the club's current official anthem.[81][84][88]

"Ô Ville Lumière" (lit. 'Oh City of Light'), to the tune of "Flower of Scotland", is another veritable club anthem for PSG supporters.[91][92] Other notable chants from supporters' groups in the Boulogne and Auteuil stands include "Le Parc est à nous" (lit. 'The Parc is ours'), "Ici, c'est Paris!" (lit. 'This is Paris!'), and "Paris est magique!" (lit. 'Paris is magical!').[81][93] Both stands began exchanging these chants during PSG matches in the 1990s.[90][94][95] "Ici, c'est Paris!" and "Paris est magique!" are also the club's most iconic mottos.[81][96][97] "Who Said I Would" by Phill Collins is also a traditional anthem for the fans. The song has accompanied the players' entry into the field since 1992.[98]

Iconic shirts

Wikimedia Commons has media related to Paris Saint-Germain FC kits.
During their first three seasons of existence, the home shirt of Paris Saint-Germain was red with blue and white details in its sleeves and neck to bring together the three colours of the club: the red and blue of Paris, and the white of Saint-Germain-en-Laye.[83][99] During the 2010–11 season, PSG wore a red shirt during home matches to commemorate their 40th anniversary.[100]

The connection between Paris Saint-Germain and the city's fashion houses is a longstanding one. French fashion designer Daniel Hechter became PSG president in 1973 and designed the club's traditional home look that same year: a blue shirt with a red vertical stripe flanked by two thinner white stripes (blue-white-red-white-blue).[99][101] First worn in the 1973–74 season, the so-called "Hechter shirt" has remained the classic home identity of PSG ever since.[83][102][103][104]

The famous jersey made its debut during a home Ligue 2 game against Red Star on 10 November 1973.[105] This was also the club's maiden match at the Parc des Princes. PSG won 3–1 as Othniel Dossevi scored the club's first goal at the stadium as well as the first with the Hechter shirt.[21] PSG stars from the 1990s and 2000s like Raí, Ronaldinho and Pauleta are associated with this kit. While wearing it, the capital club reached five European semi-finals in a row between 1993 and 1997, claimed the 1995–96 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and achieved eight consecutive wins against Le Classique arch-rivals Olympique de Marseille between 2002 and 2004.[83][106]

The general belief is that Hechter based his creation on the red-and-white jersey worn by Ajax, the dominant team in Europe at the time, but with the French flag in mind.[13][99][101] Hechter himself has denied this, though, instead claiming he was inspired by the Ford Mustang. He transposed the car's hood stripes on the shirt and employed the three colours of the club.[99] The Hechter shirt has two alternate versions: the "reversed Hechter" (red-white-blue-white-red), introduced in the 1974–75 season, and the "white Hechter" (white-blue-red-blue-white), which premiered in the 1994–95 season.[99][104][107]

It was with the club's most iconic away outfit, though, that fans saw the first big PSG team which won their maiden French Cup titles in 1982 and 1983, experienced their first European campaign in 1983, and claimed their maiden Ligue 1 crown in 1986. The shirt was white with blue and red vertical stripes on the left.[83][102] Like the Hechter jersey, it debuted in the 1973–74 season as the away kit.[99] Promoted by PSG president Francis Borelli, the white shirt was the club's home identity from 1981 to 1990.[102] Now known as the "Borelli shirt," it is synonym with PSG legends from the 1980s like Safet Sušić, Luis Fernández and Dominique Bathenay.[83][103][108]

In 2025 shirts included a design in Arabic writing for the first time; they were worn in Doha on 5 January for the Trophée des Champions match.[109][110] The design was created by calligrapher Fatma Al Sharshani.[111]

Crest evolution
The club's first crest was basically the same as the original Paris FC (PFC) logo. Having to merge and give birth to PSG using Stade Saint-Germain's stadium, the PFC crest kept its original design but the name below it changed from "Paris FC" to "Paris Saint-Germain Football Club." This badge consisted of a blue football with a red vessel inside it. The latter is a historic symbol of Paris and is present in the city's coat of arms. The name of the club was written below in red.[112]

Club crest between 1992 and 1995
PSG, however, split from PFC in 1972 and thus needed a new crest. Representing both Paris and Saint-Germain-en-Laye, the club's second crest became the basis of the one the fans know today. The round logo featured the Eiffel Tower in red against a blue background and, underneath it, two Saint-Germain symbols in white: a fleur de lys and Louis XIV's cradle.[112] Created by Christian Lentretien, former PSG board member and publicist by profession, this crest was first used in 1972 and lasted until 1982.[112][113] The Parc des Princes, the club's home stadium, appeared below it between 1982 and 1990.[112]

The stadium was dropped from the crest in 1990. Two years later, then club owners Canal+ radically changed it in 1992. The new model had the acronym "PSG" in white against a blue-white-red-white-blue background (like the colour pattern of the Hechter shirt) with "Paris Saint-Germain" underneath in white against a black background. Under pressure from supporters, the traditional crest returned in 1995 with "Paris Saint-Germain" above the tower and "1970" below the cradle. This logo went through a slight facelift in 2002, most notably featuring a darker shade of blue.[112]

At the request of the club's Qatari owners, the traditional crest underwent a major makeover in 2013.[112] "Paris" is now written in big white bold letters above a large Eiffel Tower, clearly putting forward the brand "Paris" instead of "Paris Saint-Germain". Underneath it, "Saint-Germain" is written in smaller letters below the fleur de lys.[96][114] The cradle and the club's founding year "1970" were left out.[114] PSG deputy general manager Jean-Claude Blanc said: "We are called Paris Saint-Germain but, above all, we are called Paris".[96]

Paris Saint-Germain used to host two very famous invitational competitions: the Tournoi de Paris and the Tournoi Indoor de Paris-Bercy.[115][116] Regarded as French football's most prestigious friendly tournament, the Tournoi de Paris is considered a precursor of both the Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup.[115][117] PSG began hosting it in 1975 and were crowned champions a record seven times.[115] Held at the Parc des Princes, the Tournoi de Paris was last organized in 2012.[115][118] The Tournoi Indoor de Paris-Bercy was an indoor football tournament founded by PSG in 1984 and held annually until 1991 at the AccorHotels Arena in the 12th arrondissement of Paris. Played indoors on a synthetic field and featuring seven-a-side teams, the competition featured hosts PSG and five more clubs. The Parisians lifted the trophy on two occasions, more than any other club.[116]

Since its inception, Paris Saint-Germain have played in five main stadiums: the Stade Jean-Bouin, the Stade Georges Lefèvre, the Stade Bauer, the Stade Yves-du-Manoir, and the Parc des Princes, their current home ground.[119][120] PSG took on Ligue 2 promotion rivals Red Star on 10 November 1973, for the club's first match at the Parc des Princes.[21][119] It was the curtain-raiser for that season's opening Ligue 1 match between Paris FC and Sochaux.[21] PSG moved into the ground upon its return to Ligue 1 in July 1974, ironically the same year that Paris FC were relegated.[16][119] Up until that point it had hosted Paris FC, who showed reluctance towards PSG playing there.[16][121]

From that moment on, the Parc des Princes has been the home stadium of PSG.[119] Its most prolific season in terms of average attendance is 2019–20, during which an average of 47,517 spectators went to the stadium for each match.[119][122] The attendance record for a PSG match dates back to 13 March 1983, with 49,575 spectators present in the stands of the Parc des Princes. This match pitted PSG against Belgian side Waterschei for the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup quarterfinals. The final score was a 2–0 victory for the Parisians.[123][124]

During the 1970–71 season, the club played at the Stade Jean-Bouin, concurrently with the Stade Georges Lefèvre.[119] The Jean-Bouin was privileged given that it drew significantly greater levels of fan support.[119][125] The Georges Lefèvre regularly hosted PSG matches from 1972 to 1974 as well.[119] Between 1904 and 1970, it was the home of Stade Saint-Germain, club which merged with Paris FC to form PSG in 1970.[119][126] PSG played again at the Jean-Bouin in 1973–74, alternating their home games with the Georges Lefèvre and the Parc des Princes.[125]

PSG played at the Stade de Paris, today known as Stade Bauer, for the first time during the 1971–72 season.[119] It was used again by the club once in 1976–77 and 1977–78, and twice in 1978–79 due to construction work on the lawn of the Parc des Princes.[119][125] Similarly, the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir, as its officially called, welcomed PSG for three matches in 1971–72, once more in 1974–75, and one last time in 1975–76 because the Parc des Princes was under renovation.[119][125]

Training facilities
Main articles: Campus PSG and Camp des Loges
Campus PSG has been the club's training ground since July 2023.[127] Located in Poissy, it replaced the Camp des Loges, PSG's historical training facility.[127][128] Owned and financed by the club, the venue brings together PSG's male and female football, handball and judo teams, as well as the football and handball academies.[129][130] Each division have its own dedicated facilities.[131] Campus PSG will have a stadium, which will complement the club's home ground of the Parc des Princes.[129] It is due to be built during the second phase of the project, after 2024.[132] PSG's male team moved into Campus PSG on 10 July 2023.[127] They completed their first group training session there on 18 July 2023, and played their first game on 21 July 2023.[133][134] It was a friendly match against Le Havre which ended in a 2–0 victory for PSG.[134]

The Camp des Loges is a training ground located in Saint-Germain-en-Laye.[135] It hosted PSG's male team from July 1970 to June 2023.[128] The venue also turned into the training facilities of the club's academy when it opened on 4 November 1975.[135][128] The current version of the Camp des Loges opened in November 2008, and is the second to have been built on the site, with the first opening its doors in June 1904.[128][135] It was renamed Ooredoo Training Centre, as part of a sponsorship deal with Ooredoo, in September 2013.[128] The complex hosted the training sessions of the club's female team between June 2023 and January 2024.[128][136] The men's team left the Camp des Loges for Campus PSG in July 2023.[127] The club's academy and female team moved to the new site in January 2024.[136][137] Rugby union club Stade Français are expected to become the new tenants of the Camp des Loges in the summer of 2024.[138]

Paris Saint-Germain holds many records, most notably being the most successful French club in history in terms of official titles won, with 50.[1][49][139] They are the record holders of all national competitions, having clinched twelve Ligue 1 championships, fourteen Coupe de France, nine Coupe de la Ligue, and twelve Trophée des Champions. Their trophy cabinet also includes one Ligue 2 title.[49][140] In international football, PSG have claimed one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and one UEFA Intertoto Cup.[49]

Their victory in the 1995–96 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup makes PSG the sole French side to have won this trophy, one of only two French clubs to have won a major European competition, and the youngest European team to do so.[46][141] They are also the only side to have won the Ligue 1 title after being at the top of the table from the first until the last round (2022–23),[142] the Coupe de France without conceding a single goal (1992–93 and 2016–17),[143] five Coupe de la Ligue in a row (2014–2018),[144] four back-to-back Coupe de France (2015–2018),[145] and eight consecutive Trophée des Champions (2013–2020).[146]

PSG have won all four national titles in a single season on four occasions. This feat is known as the domestic quadruple. The Red and Blues have completed the domestic double, the league and league cup double, the domestic cup double, the domestic treble and the league three-peat several times as well. Therefore, PSG are the club with the most domestic doubles and league and league cup doubles, one of two sides to have achieved the league three-peat twice, and the only team to have won the domestic cup double, the domestic treble and the domestic quadruple.[49]

Since their inception, PSG have completed 53 seasons, of which 50 have been played in the highest division in French football, known as Ligue 1.[1][125][147][148] In 2022–23, they celebrated their 49th consecutive campaign in Ligue 1, which makes them the competitions's longest-serving club.[148][149] PSG have played continuously in Ligue 1 from the 1974–75 season onwards.[148][149] Since then, the Parisians have won twelve league titles, finishing first more frequently than in any other position.[148] Having come second in nine league campaigns, PSG have therefore made up the top two spots on 21 occasions.[148] They have also reached the top five 29 times, which represents more than half of the club's seasons in Ligue 1.[148] PSG's lowest-ever finish is 16th, both in 1971–72 (their first in Ligue 1) and 2007–08, when they escaped relegation on the final day of the season, with a 2–1 win at Sochaux.[148]

Supporters

Paris Saint-Germain are the most popular football club in France, with 22% of fans identifying as Parisians. Marseille come second with 20%, while Lyon are third with 14%.[150] PSG are also one of the most widely supported teams with 35 million supporters worldwide, more than any other French club.[151] The Parc des Princes has been the home stadium of the club since July 1974.[119] It has four stands: Tribune Borelli, Tribune Auteuil, Tribune Paris and Tribune Boulogne.[152] Historically, the Auteuil and Boulogne stands, better known as Virage Auteuil (VA) and Kop of Boulogne (KoB), have housed PSG's most hardcore supporters' groups, the so-called ultras, which have made the Parc one of Europe's most feared venues as well as one of the best in terms of atmosphere.[153][154][155] Other more friendly, family-oriented groups have usually gathered in the Paris and Borelli stands.[156]

Lacking a big passionate fanbase, the club began offering cheaper season tickets to young supporters in 1976. These fans were placed in the Kop K, located in the K section of the Paris stand at the Parc des Princes.[93][157] Following an increase in ticket prices, Kop K supporters moved to the Boulogne stand in 1978, and the Kop of Boulogne was born.[93][158][159] There, the club's first Italian-style ultra group, Boulogne Boys, were founded in 1985,[159][160][161] followed by English-inspired kopistes Gavroches and Rangers. However, several KoB groups, including Commando Pirate and Casual Firm, took English hooligans as dubious role models and violence rapidly escalated.[156][162]

In response, club owners Canal+ encouraged non-violent KoB fans to take place in the Auteuil stand at the other end of the stadium, giving birth to the Virage Auteuil in 1991, spearheaded by ultra groups Supras Auteuil, Lutece Falco and Tigris Mystic.[156][158][163] The measure worked at first but, slowly, a violent, racially motivated rivalry arose between the two stands.[158][163][164] Things came to a head in 2010 before a match against Marseille. Boulogne fan Yann Lorence was killed following a fight between groups from both stands outside the Parc, forcing PSG president Robin Leproux to take action.[158][165] In what was known as Plan Leproux, the club exiled all groups from the Parc and banned them from away matches as well.[154] It took six years for the ultras to reclaim their place in the stadium. Former VA supporters formed the Collectif Ultras Paris (CUP) in February 2016, and the club agreed to their return in October 2016.[154][165][166]

PSG have granted official status to 16 groups at the Parc des Princes since 1975.[167][168][169][170] Based in Auteuil, the CUP are currently the only ultra group officially recognized by the club.[155][170] They share the stadium with fellow authorized groups Les Amis du PSG, Hoolicool, PSG Grand Sud, Vikings 27 and Handicap-PSG in the Paris stand; and Titi Fosi in the Borelli stand.[167][168][169] In the past, PSG also acknowledged Boulogne Boys, Gavroches, Rangers and Brigade Paris from Boulogne; and Supras Auteuil, Lutece Falco, Tigris Mystic, Authentiks and Puissance Paris from Auteuil.[167][168] More recently, unofficial ultra groups Block Parisii and Résistance Parisienne have settled at Boulogne and are trying to convince the club of relaunching the KoB.[156][171][172] Other active associations include former CUP members Karsud, which were excluded from the group in 2017, and therefore vetoed from all club matches, due to accusations of hooliganism.[156][173][174] They are the club's last remaining organized hooligan group.[156][174]
