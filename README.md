# Objective
Creating a series of small projects for my own practice!

# Requirements
aaah... too much to write down! I'm putting all projects together because I'm lazy lol.

# Project list
1. Wordle
guess a five-letter word in limited number of guesses.
Source of words: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/english-word-frequency?resource=download

    Possible fixes: if a letter is repeated in user's guess but not in the answer word, it will be shown as two yello letters or one green + one yellow which is not accurate. 

2. Word Cloud
Create an image of words based on their frequency from a text file

3. Search engine
Create a simple search engine based on a series of files fed into the project.
