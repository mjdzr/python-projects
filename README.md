# Project 1:
Worldle - guess a five-letter word in limited number of guesses.
Source of words: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/english-word-frequency?resource=download

Possible fixes: if a letter is repeated in user's guess but not in the answer word, it will be shown as two yello letters or one green + one yellow which is not accurate.
