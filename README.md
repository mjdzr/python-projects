# Project list
## Folder 0: older projects (0_older_projects)
This section works on older pytopia projects.
**1. Wordle:**
guess a five-letter word in limited number of guesses.
Source of words: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/english-word-frequency?resource=download

    Possible fixes: if a letter is repeated in user's guess but not in the answer word, it will be shown as two yello letters or one green + one yellow which is not accurate. 

**2. Word Cloud:**
**Create an image of words based on their frequency from a text file

**3. Search engine:**
Create a simple search engine based on a series of files fed into the project.

**4. Guess Number:**
Guess a random number by providing up to 10 guesses between 1 to 10.

## Level 1 projects
pytopia.ai suggests three levels of python projects. Level 1 is the simplest form of projects. Each of these projects contain their own description outlined in README.md in their own folder.
Level 1 projects focused on simple usage of python and does not rely on external projects as often as it does in Levels 2 and 3.
